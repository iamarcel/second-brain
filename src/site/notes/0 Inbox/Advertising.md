# Ad formats per platform
## Facebook
Facebook is primarily entertainment so **edutainment** is key.

Think about: **how likely is someone to share this?** Bonus points if it makes them look smart when they share it.

- Is it interesting to read?
- Conversational?
- Have you clearly articulated a few insights that aren't common, conventional wisdom for people interested in your expertise?
- Is your ad intriguing — does it capture the reader's interest?
- Is it authentic?
- Is there an “ah ha” moment in it where the reader is shown a different perspective?
