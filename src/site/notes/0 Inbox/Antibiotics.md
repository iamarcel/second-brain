Antibiotics kill (all) bacteria, so they're useful when you're infected by bacteria. They have serious disadvantages too, so in general we avoid using them:

- Stuff like flu and cold are viruses so antibiotics don't do anything against it
- Antibiotics kill your own good bacteria too so you're making a big mess of your own body
- If you take them this quickly, bacteria will end up getting resistant and then antibiotics won't help when you do actually need them later
