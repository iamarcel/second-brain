Books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don’t realize it.

> "What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic." – Carl Sagan

When you pull on certain strings from the lecture, you might discover that _you had never really understood_, though you’d certainly _thought_ you understood during the lecture.

_it’s hard to convey knowledge_. Most lecture attendees don’t absorb the intended knowledge; most book readers don’t absorb the intended knowledge. Failure is the default here.

What is transmissionism?
?
“[transmissionism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transmissionism).” It’s the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another.

Readers must learn specific reflective strategies. “What questions should I be asking? How should I summarize what I’m reading?” Readers must run their own feedback loops. “Did I understand that? Should I re-read it? Consult another text?”
