How I doubled my results in so many areas of my life. Sometimes doubled my sanity.

**This is for those that want to become ultra successful in every area of life.**

Sounds hyperbole. A lot of people don't have that ambition (in all areas).

This is for those that have high agency. Do the work. Are assertive. Wanna do things.

Who wants to feel the day more? I had to *teach myself* that.

Only 2 change your life:

I had unfair advantages: 2 parents that loved me.

I want to mentor the people who become the leaders of the next generation.

**One of the ultimate strategies: getting around other successful people.**

There's a couple 1000 people who are trying to get in.

# 5 strategies that doubled my results

The Ultra Webinar 2023 focused on the theme of achieving exceptional success in various aspects of life, including career, personal growth, and overall well-being.

The speaker began by acknowledging the diverse global audience and their collective ambition to achieve remarkable results in their lives. The primary focus was on individuals who seek comprehensive success across all life domains, rather than focusing narrowly on singular aspects like financial gain or physical fitness.

**The session was designed for those with a high-intensity, goal-oriented mindset, characterized by a proactive approach to life and a willingness to work diligently towards their objectives.** The speaker emphasized the need for personal responsibility and control over one's life, striving for continuous improvement and achievement.

**The seminar was not suitable for individuals with high levels of cynicism, pessimism, or distrust, as these attitudes are counterproductive to the principles being taught.**

The speaker, drawing from his extensive experience in leading seminars, coaching successful clients, and authoring best-selling books, shared insights on how to overcome common challenges faced by ambitious individuals. **These challenges include stress, loneliness, and uncertainty, often exacerbated by being the primary ambitious person or breadwinner in one's circle.**

Central to the webinar's philosophy was the concept of the "Ultra mindset," which the speaker credited as a significant contributor to his success. This mindset involves high standards, expectations, and performance, going beyond just meeting the minimum requirements in various life areas. The speaker stressed the importance of maintaining a performance edge and avoiding complacency, which can lead to stagnation.

A key focus was on developing a systematic approach to success, moving away from random, unstructured efforts. This system involves making strategic choices, aligning with one’s long-term goals, and avoiding the pitfall of being driven by past conditions or limited perspectives.

The webinar also emphasized the value of networking and being part of groups or clubs that foster high performance and success. Such communities provide support, mentorship, and the opportunity to learn from others' experiences. The speaker shared his experiences in various industries, highlighting the diversity of his client base and the wide applicability of the principles discussed.

In conclusion, the speaker encouraged attendees to adopt the Ultra mindset and embrace a holistic approach to success, emphasizing the need for belief in oneself, strategic planning, and the pursuit of growth in all life areas.
