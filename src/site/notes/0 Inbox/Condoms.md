# Determining the right size
Condom sizing is confusing, so pay attention to what you buy.

The length doesn't really matter, it's the girth that does.

Condom girth is expressed in **nominal width**, the width when a condom is flat on the table. This is not the same as the diameter. *The nominal width is half of the circumference,* so measure your penis' circumference when erect, with a piece of string or something, and divide it by two.

**Buy a condom with a nominal width slightly less than half of your erect penis' circumference.** It *should* stretch a bit so there's a snug fit.

Durex condoms have a misleading girth measurement. They have a shape that's narrow just below the head and gets wider towards the base. The measurement expressed is the measurement at the base. Their classic size (56mm nominal) fits most people snugly.

Skyn condoms are narrower but stretch more.

# Best brands & models
The Skyn condoms are most often recommended as people's favorites. They feel thinner than the classic Durex ones. They're of a different material so people who have a latex allergy might be better off. They still don't recommend it for those people though.

I prefer the Durex *shape* over the Skyn shape. Skyn condoms are straight so they kind of squish the head and you partner won't feel it well. Durex condoms leave more space for it.

I like the thinner ones. Durex Nudes are great. The *Orgasm Intense* ones are interesting too, they have little nibs and a gel on it that feels minty.
