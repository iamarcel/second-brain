# The Copythinking Triangle
**We don't want to compete.** Find a gold mine where you can start digging gold alone.

Try to find a *gap* in the first of:
1. Your product / you
2. Your market / audience
3. The competitors

Preferably your product, or a bandwagon of your audience, or artificially create a gap by doing something different from the competitors.

# Double-Take Research
The first level of research is finding this goldmine.
Second level is market research, by looking at (mostly indirect) competitors.

# Arrow with a name on it
Don't fight directly, because the enemy is already familiar with those tactics.

Choose your battlefield on two levels:
1. Sophistication levels (most marketing is at highest levels)
2. Awareness levels: unaware vs problem aware vs solution aware

When you have this down, writing copy becomes easy because it's so precise.

# Bending Reality
Bend the unlimited details of any product so it becomes the perfect named arrow.
