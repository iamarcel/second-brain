4. Here's my story of the solution...
5. Here's my and my students' results...
    This is what happened then.
6. Here's the old world and the new world...
    This is how things have changed in the world and in the marketplace. See? There's a lot more to learn.
    
    This creates credibility of _thinking_.
    
    You can tell multiple examples of how the world has changed.
7. Here's the solution
    Explain a step-by-step system in a framework.

9. This is the first thing you should do after this...
    This gives people _confidence_ to start applying what they've just learned.

# Common mistakes
- Telling your story too soon. Make sure you've _related_ enough with the audience first.
- Sharing too many stories. Just one or two is enough.
- Not _absolutely LOVING_ what you're doing.

> Your job is to maintain your energy and your audience's energy. Keep it moving. Go in crescendo.

- Making it too long. Make it as long as needed but not longer.
- Not ending in a crescendo. Ramping _up_ at the end will feel like you're _connecting_.
