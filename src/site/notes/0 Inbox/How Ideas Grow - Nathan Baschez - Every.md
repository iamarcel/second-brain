Many narratives spread in a self-perpetuating matter: network effects.

For example: everyone talks about AI, there's more money, there's more development, it gets better, and more people talk about it.

Ideas have value intrinsically and also due to network effects. These dimensions are orthogonal:
- *Crony Beliefs* (e.g., flat earth theory) have no intrinsic merit but believed solely because of the social value
- *Merit Beliefs* have a lot of intrinsic merit and are believed even though there's no social value
