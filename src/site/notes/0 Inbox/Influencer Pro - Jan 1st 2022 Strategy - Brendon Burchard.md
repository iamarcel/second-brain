# Content
You need to have consistency and commitment to excellence.

You have to keep producing great content.

To win this year, your content must be:
- Encouraging (you need to be the encourager)
	- You’re gonna be the person who believes in your audience’s capabilities
	- We’ve gone through hard times and people need this
	- If I don’t hear you explicitly stating you’re trying to encourage people, you’re not doing it
	- **Repeated, explicit communication is the only way to create a brand, a deep connection and to start a movement.**
	- What teachers are really doing is *encouraging learning.*
	- This has to be the year you stop hoping people would get the message
- Specificity
	- If you’re not repeatedly talking about your core offers, core values, core beliefs, core takeaways—pff good luck breaking through.

**Create a communication plan.**
- What values are you going to communicate over and over?
- What key words are you going to use again and again?

Otherwise your audience isn’t going to get you.

## 1. Weekly Newsletter
Please make sure you have a weekly newsletter going out to your audience. This presupposes you’re capturing emails. Your career is today still predicated on capturing emails.

This is how you:
- Touch base
- Solidify key messages
- Demonstrate expertise
- Be a consistent part of their life

Newsletter needs a link to *long-form content*. In 2022, long-form content will continue to be the differentiator.

If we never go further than short-form, we never get depth, we never get the connection we need to have them buy stuff. You’ll be someone they *follow*, not someone they *buy from*.

Doesn’t mean all podcast episodes need to be long, just have one a week. Once a week, have a video over 30 minutes.

Send a big long love letter to your audience.

## 2. 4x per day on social media
That’s so much! No it’s okay.

You don’t need to be everywhere, you get to choose your platform. You don’t even need social media at all to make a killing.

But if you care about scale and reach, impact of your messaging—the only reason you’re not consistent on social media is that something inside of you is blocking.

All different age ranges today are making it.

Stop making excuses and start using social media as a way to hit people with goodness. Schedule for 6 or 7AM your time and then every 4 hours after.

Not all of your content should be new.
- 1 should be new
- 1 should be “best of” (have a Best Of folder you recycle); make it look differently or post the same dang one!
- 1 should be a feature of a client, or a promotion, or a link to something else you’ve done

Since I’ve been measuring it, 2007, the algorithm favors this, it has not changed.

## 3. What content? It should begin with and centered upon what your audience is searching for
Who is your customer? What are they searching for? Who are they scrolling by? What are their core concepts and phrases that help them solve their pain or achieve their ambition?

Also focus on your artistry, your ambition, what you care about.

A-Z strategy: write the alphabet. Each of those letters begins a topic related to your topic. This helps you brainstorm.

## 4. Batch Film Everything
If you haven’t figured this out yet this will be your breakthrough. Record a *whole day long*. Knock out weeks of content in a single day.

If you can’t show me your next scheduled block time to create content, you’re winging it, you’re going to burn out and you’re going to serve below your level of potential.

## 5. Always practice [[0 Inbox/Circular Viralocity\|Circular Viralocity]]
This is super simple:
1. Take a piece of that long-form video content
2. Splice it into clips
3. Grab transcripts and create quote cards out of it
4. Make a long-form blog post out of that
5. Take those little clips and put them all across the internet, and link them back to the original blog post where the video lives

Now see which one becomes popular, put them into your Best Of.

Wait a few weeks or months and post it again!

Just keep going like this.

That’s how I’ve taken people who had no following—BAM thousands, tens of thousands, millions of followers.

## 6. Use leadership messaging!
You have to choose at some point in life the role model mindset. Be a demonstration of your work for others. Because when they see you do it they’re empowered and inspired.

Don’t just post the pretty picture—people won’t think about following, buying or joining a movement.

Your impact is predicated upon your leadership messaging. Learn to position yourself as a leader in the space. This is what matters to build community.

People need leadership in dark days and the values that come from that: openness, inclusivity, collaboration, vision, operational know-how, the ability to work through difficult times, moments and emotions.

Selfie culture vs. service culture.

When you think of this as a *profession* or *career* instead of a side hustle, you start thinking as a leader. Still be a pro!

# Campaigns
You need to know:
- The evergreen campaigns
- What’s running live

Simplify your campaigns to this.

## Quarterly Launches
This means a live campaign in real-time. Actively supporting on social media including going live.

Every quarter, promote for 2 weeks.
- Add a lot of value
- Capture email
- Make offer
- Add bonuses
- 72h deadline

If you don't have scheduled campaigns yet, you're not a business, you're just hustling.

**A campaign is a *series of promotions* with a deadline. It's a period of time where you post a ton of stuff.**

This can be a course, a service, referral program, high-ticket offer,...

## $7-$10 sale to upsells
Also called: tripwire, offer gate,...

1. Charge people do something
2. Do payment flow, upsell

E.g., sell a book and have an order bump on the order page.

Without this in place it's hard to build real wealth.

This doesn't mean you don't need brand deals etc., those are the baseline.

## Webinar
They're back and converting really well. I don't know why and I don't care.

Hold a webinar, sell things for $150+.

What to sell? See [[Offer Grid\|Offer Grid]] in [[0 Inbox/Thought Leader Roadmap\|Thought Leader Roadmap]].

Most of you only need 3 things to sell.

## Free Trials
Maybe free access to a course, then upsell.

Make sure within 2 weeks they see a high-ticket offer. You need to have that in place first.

## 5-day challenges
Longer challenges will underperform. Long free trials? People don't have the attention span.

## Doing this
The more of them you do, the higher your income. You don't have to do everything—you have to get in the game, be passionate about leading your community.
