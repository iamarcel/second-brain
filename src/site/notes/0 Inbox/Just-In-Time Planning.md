When working we often jump between points of attention and it's easy to lose track in them. E.g., in programming you're searching in 20 files before you know where to start.

Sometimes we can't plan out what we need to do, but that's okay.

We can drastically improve our performance if we track what we need to do as we're doing it.

With JIT Planning, you write down just as much of a plan as you can think of. Check off things you've done, add things as soon as you think of them, reorder when needed. You can always return to the task list and do the next unchecked thing.
