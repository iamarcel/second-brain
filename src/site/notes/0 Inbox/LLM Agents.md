> A novel kind of system-level risk created by widely-deployed models like GPT-4 is the risk created by independent high-impact decision-makers relying on decision assistance from models whose outputs are correlated or interact in complex ways. For instance, if multiple banks concurrently rely on GPT-4 to inform their strategic thinking about sources of risks in the macroeconomy, they may inadvertantly correlate their decisions and create systemic risks that did not previously exist.
