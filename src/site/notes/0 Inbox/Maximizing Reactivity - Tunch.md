# Brainstorm
- Advantages
	- Less code
	- Improved rendering performance
	- Clear side-effects
	- Less bugs
- Why?
	- Understanding
		- Basically functional programming: you know what goes in and what comes out
	- Stability
		- Immutability
		- But there's *more*: not just *what* is fixed as immutable, but also *when* is explicit
		- This means things change when they need to
		- Refactoring is easy, no need to consider the new thing everywhere
	- Performance
		- React rendering is shit because it doesn't know shit
		- Default Angular rendering is even worse
		- But if everything is reactive it knows perfectly
		- RxAngular: default zone-based renderer isn't very efficient, we need to change it out
- How?
	- State management: the best solution isn't to fix it, it's to skip it
	- Everything is a stream
	- The least amount of `Subject`s as possible  (they're fake)
	- No logic in event handler methods
	- Refactoring flow
		- Properties + modifying methods -> computed Observable
		- Event handler -> Subject trigger -> computed Observable
		- Sharing across components: BehaviorSubject-in-a-service
		- Hey wait this is state management
- What?
	- Everything `OnPush`
		- Pushes you to structure your app better, declaratively
		- Like strict mode
	- All your fields are `readonly` (except inputs)
	- Reactive-Angular library
		- \*rxLet
		- PushPipe
		- \*rxIf
			- else, suspense, error, complete
		- \*rxFor
	- Define observables from other observables in the constructor
		- The template handles subscribing, that's perfect
		- Reuse the same subscription in the template (rxLet)
	- Only `.subscribe()` if you *really* have no other option
	- Implement side effects with `tap()` and combine them in a `merge` so you only have a *single subscription in the entire component*!
	- Passing Observables in `Input()`s
	- Opting out of `Zone`
		- Run outside of Zone
		- Unpatch events
- Ummm forget everything I said
	- Signals
	- See SolidJS
