Start your subscription program. It's one of the best things you can do for your business—and you don't need *anything* to get started.

This gives you a baseline of monthly, recurring, income. It's a game changer.

# How to Make a Subscription Program
**Don't give away a huge library.** You don't *need* a Netflix-like library and people don't *want* it. Either they're overwhelmed and don't look at the things, and don't see the value—or they download everything and then cancel. Just unlock maybe 2 months of past replays, and if you want to give a library, make it unlock slowly over time.

**Go live 1-2 hours each month.** This is what almost everyone in the industry ends up with as the best frequency and timing. Split this about 50-50 between the scheduled training and Q&A. Actually go live, this is really valuable. The tech does *not* need to be fancy.

**Give 3-5 teaching points.** This is *advanced training*, not social media. Make sure you have good teaching topics every single month. Also, give some resource after every training. This can be the summary, a worksheet based on the points (you can even give that beforehand so they can work along).

**Make the Q&A fun.** Give away stuff to people who ask questions. Make fun of yourself and have self-deprecating humor so it's a fun place to be.

**Create a feeling of exclusivity.** Give the messaging regularly that what you're teaching here is exclusive to them, try to find things you've never shared elsewhere.

**Ideally, give immediate value and some more one month in.** Give one bonus mini-course or something that customers unlock as soon as they sign up. Then if you can put in the extra work, unlock another one after 30 days.

**Give a gift every 90 days.** The 90-day cycle is when people tend to cancel, so have something ready as a surprise about every 90 days. This can be as simple as a one-pager, a small extra video, or anything else.

# How to Promote a Subscription Program
**Monthly Campaign.** Every month, you can email your *entire* list announcing the topic you'll be discussing with the "insiders." Then after the session, you can share your 3-5 main points with everyone and get them to sign up so they can see the replay.

**Pricing.** Personal development usually $20-$100, marketing $40-$400.
