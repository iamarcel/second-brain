OMRPG Framework

## Outcome
What's the *real* outcome?
- Lifestyle
- Feeling
- Future
- Sense of Self

Be careful to not get obsessed about a *single* thing because we get obsessed and we forget on the other aspects of our life that are really important.

## Model
What's the Model I'm trying to build to get to that outcome? As in "business model."

## Rhythm
What are the specific habits, routines, responsibilities and outputs?

What's the rhythm over the course of a week or month that you're going to run over—and over—and over again?

This is why you need to give your employees GrowthDay. If your company feels like chaos, it's the rhythm that's missing.



## People
Don't *start* with people! Otherwise you got a lot of people running around milling around bumping into each other.

Most people aren't B or C-people. They're just playing outside of the game because the outcome, model and rhythm aren't set up for them.

## Growth Metrics
What is it specifically that you would like to grow? Yes KPI's but also *actual* things you're trying to grow. You want x—what does that *mean*? Tell me what you're trying to measure, what you're trying to get.

Conscientiousness.
Willing to plan, to pay attention to the details, to follow up, to follow a routine and be disciplined. Diligent, thoughtful, more likely to follow through. We've got to *train* this especially in a world filled with distraction.

We want you back in your life.
