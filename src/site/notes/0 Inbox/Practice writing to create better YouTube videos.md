Creating good video content comes down to good writing. Video is not *just* writing but the core of it is. In fact, a simple video of you talking to the camera can become very popular—just look at TED.

Good. Writing. Matters.

People don't just care about the content. They also care about *how it's presented*. There's a reason the famous people who've been talking about their ideas suddenly explode: they've reached the elbow of exponential growth where their message is so fleshed out and practiced that they speak about it with certainty, confidence and clarity. The only way you get there is with *practice*.

It's often said that to become popular online, you just say the same thing in 1000 different ways. There are three reasons why this works:

- It's easier to stay consistent. You're not stuck with having to come up with new ideas.
- Because you practice explaining the same idea so often, over time you'll get to a point where you're confident and clear about it—this is what people listen to.
- A lot of creators starting out focus on too advanced topics—and forget that a lot of their audience is *way far behind* them.

When an idea is presented with high levels of enthusiasm, clarity and confidence—people listen. They *feel* there's something good. They *know* it's valuable. They *stay* because a part of them recognizes the expertise immediately.

You get to these three keys with one thing:

Practice.

I've found this so many times in my own content. The second time I make a video about something similar, it feels oddly easier—until I remember I actually talked about the *same things* earlier! I explain to my friends what I'm thinking about. I write a script and edit it before I record. I do multiple takes.

So the next time you shy away from people teaching writing, stay for a few more minutes. [[4 Archive/Notes/Dan Koe\|Dan Koe]] doesn't say you should get on Twitter for no reason. It's an outlet for writing. Because it makes you write, it makes you think. Reflect. Distill your ideas. Twitter is a great tool to test how well different ways of wording something stick around.
