## Step 1: Find 5 Keywords
Find keywords your customers search for.

Use Google Autocomplete: start with a keyword, and find related words.
- They are linked to current trends
- They're long-tail keywords

Don't go after really competitive keywords for new sites.

Now scroll down to the *related searches* section at the bottom.

**Exploding Topics** is another tool to find keywords that aren't competitive yet.

## Step 2: Create amazing content for each of the keywords
Sometimes huge complete guides word.

Nowadays: **search intent**, the main goal a user has when typing a query into a search engine. Information? Buy something? Browse? Compare?

The better you can satisfy intent, the higher you'll rank.
(eg., best cat food is not for buying, but for comparison)

Create something that's unique and bring something great to the table.

## Step 3: Optimize it for SEO
Just focus on creating great content that satisfies search intent.

Don't worry about keywords or related keywords or whatever.

"Yes, this is exactly what I'm looking for."

- In the title
- First couple hundred words
- A few more times on the page

That's 90% of on-page SEO right now.

## Step 4: Optimize for user experience
Backlinks are still super-important but not as important anymore.

Key rank: how happy does it make the customer.

Quick bounce back to Google is a bad sign. If they stay it's good.

- Frontload the value as much as possible. Don't hide tidbits. No or short intros (just to let them know they're in the right place).
- Layout and design. Easy to read. Short paragraphs. Healthline is the gold standard for good layout.

## Step 5: Build backlinks
Strategy for new sites with zero authority: *be the source*.

- Find a statistic in your industry you can write about and expand on. At the top of the page you put the easy numbers to share. That makes you the easy source for bloggers and journalists to share.
	- Target really specific stats (super low competition)

# Reverse Outreach
Write content that gets in front of bloggers automatically and that they're very likely to link to.

Not the same as "great content" because your target customer won't link to you.

**Create content specifically for bloggers and journalists to link to.**

Find a stat online and make it easy for bloggers to find it.

## Journalist Keywords
Depends on the niche. 
Look at competitors' pages with a lot of links. They often link to a specific page with a certain stat.

Specific keywords depend.

## Outline how you want it to look
Really short intro.
Spoon-feed the stat as high as possible.

## Create your stat page
- Put the stat very high up
- Then supplement it with supporting statistics

High quality data will be recent, structured and easy to find.

"Sometimes I search for high difficulty keywords, and then I search if there's a page for that specific question that answers it quickly?"

What are people already linking to? Sources, numbers, data. So be the source.

## Funnel authority to important pages
Even without anything you'll rank better because links = authority.

Link to other pages further down the funnel on these pages.

Not necessarily the productâ€”these pages are a lot for journalists.
