> The reason that most of us are unhappy most of the time is that we set our goals — not for the person we’re going to be when we reach them — we set our goals for the person we are when we set them. (Jim Coudal)

#source/ai Let's now dive in into understanding it on a deep level, and applying it practically in real life. This quote is trying to tell us that we tend to set goals for ourselves based on our current state of being, instead of looking at the future self we want to be and setting goals for that. We often make short-term decisions based on our current desires and feelings, instead of making long-term decisions that reflect what our ideal self would do. This can lead to feelings of unhappiness because the end result is not in line with who we want to become.

To apply this practically in real life, we can start by taking a step back and reflecting on our long-term goals and values. What kind of person do you want to become? What kind of life do you want to live? Once you have identified your long-term goals and values, you can use them as a guide when making decisions about your short-term actions. Instead of just focusing on immediate gratification, consider how your choices today will affect who you will be tomorrow. This will help ensure that the decisions you make now are aligned with the person you ultimately want to become.
