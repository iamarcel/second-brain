# Lesson 1: Breath & Mind Control
Mind, breath, physical stress are interlinked.

Ejaculation delay comes to staying relaxed and not going "into" the (over)stimulation.

Key: being able to keep your awareness within your body.

## Foundation: deep breathing.

Breathing deeply through the belly and relaxing everything—do this as often as you can, minimum for 5-10 minutes daily.

- As slow as possible
- As deep as possible
- Release all tension on the exhale

## Mental Training
Large part: being able to focus. Jedi mind, in control.

Count your breaths so you know when you're focusing and practice it. See if you can count to 10.

## Next level: sexual practice
Practice everything first on your own.

Stimulate yourself and focus on your breath. Breath is the primary focus. Don't use porn, it's overstimulating.

Be aware of arousal level. Try to not get over 7-8 for the first 5-10 minutes.

Try to not get into "the rush" as your arousal increases. Longer time span, less stimulation, focus on breathing, and enjoy this.

If you need more distracting, add the counting here too.

10-15 minutes is the practice.

Closing—if you're retaining semen, stop simulating and deep breathe until arousal is under control.

# Lesson 2: Pelvic Floor Relaxation
Just doing Kegel exercises a lot creates tension so accelerates ejaculation. Over time it can also become muscular imbalance.

Do reverse Kegels. Pushing out the pelvic floor, engaging the abss a bit, J likes it after you breathed in and push down the air in the belly.

There's the front area (push out pee)
and the back area (push out poop)

Don't push out *too* much.

Practice: daily push & hold for 10 seconds, relax 5 seconds, do 10 reps. Alternate front-back. 2-3 sets per day.

Don't do Kegels every day, reverse ones is great.

## In sexual practice: self
Have at least 15 minutes.

As arousal increases, add in **rhythmic reverse Kegels together with the breath**. Johnathan relaxes at the end of the in hold and during breathe out.

Mind is very important: move your focus on sex thoughts vs. awareness to dial in arousal level.

The meditative state, closing eyes, focusing on the body—leads to arousal control.

An extra practice: see how close you can get and how much you can get back using those reverse Kegels.

# Lesson 3: Sexual kung fu breathing
To strengthen abdominal (diaphragm) muscle, stay parasympathetic, and get sexual energy out of the genitals by squeezing the butt. Flexing brings blood to that muscle.

Exercise:
- Stand up
- Breathe in into the belly
- Hold as long as possible
- Push the diaphragm down, making the belly bigger, pushing *down*
- Hold long comfortably
- Breathe out and relax
- One transition breath

It really works well during sex.

You might feel sore in the diaphragm.

Part two, during the exhale:
- Wide stance
- Gentle butt cheek, pushing the knees outward screwing in. Rhythmically squeeze squeeze squeeze
- Pull in the abs
- Add sort of reverse Kegel

You can do the butt squeeze as you're thrusting.

With a partner this technique is difficult with position. If you're standing it works well. But the thrusting-butt works to move energy up the spine. Practice in different positions.
