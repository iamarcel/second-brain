We share a lot more DNA with mushrooms than other plants and substances. This means bioavailability of medicinal mushrooms is much better.

All mushrooms are fungi, not all fungi are mushrooms.

Mycelium breaking rocks, everywhere, invisible, network of information between plants.

Morning

Shiitake is culinary. Immune modulating. Key: cardiovascular system, cleans it and loosens it. “Beauty mushroom” for women because when the cardio system starts working well the skin is the first thing we notice.

Chaga king of mushrooms. Antioxidants (dual extract Chaga most in any compound). Chaga was centerpiece of many indigenous cultures.

Noon and afternoon

Cordyceps. Not many studies. Energy giving powers. Feel effect right away. Minutes. VO2max, peak power, 

Lions mane. Smarter, and if you stop it declines after 4 weeks. Compounding effect over multiple days, weeks, months.

Miitake. “My new favorite.” Myriad, in particular weight management, diabetes.

Turketail? Not well studied.

Turnella. Beauty mushroom. Secret formula behind all cosmetic brands. 

Evening

Reishi. Chemo patients. **STRESS** and sleep. 

Bonus

Psilocybin. Stamets stack.
