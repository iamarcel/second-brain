These are so awesome. They’re open back “in ear” headphones. There’s a hole in the middle so ambient sound always passes through. They look great. You control them by tapping your **skin**. How high tech is that!

You can listen to music, stream phone audio privately and you’re still fully present with the world. You’re not jacking in, just having the opportunity to augment. Openness is *primary*, not an afterthought like “transparency modes” in other in ear monitors.
