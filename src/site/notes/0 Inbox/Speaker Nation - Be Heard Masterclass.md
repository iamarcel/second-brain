Every intense emotion you've experienced is a story.

Sometimes when you're holding something in your hand, it's not nearly as valuable as when it's in someone else's hand.

I'm willing to go on stage and be wrong. You know why? Because I'm willing to admit it.

**You're one talk away.**

Size of stage effect = size of audience \* quality of talk

The stage effect is one of the most powerful forces for change in the world.

If one talk would do it for you:
- What would it be about?
- What would that breakthrough be?
