AoE is built on the premise that your email marketing is a *system* that produces *emergent* results, not a collection of random parts with different jobs to accomplish.

As a result, AoE campaigns work together — systemically — to help you reach more people, create more value, earn more money, and feel good about the way you're showing up in the world.

We call that [marketing with integrity](https://themodernmarketingsystem.com/create-better-prospects-part-2/).

AoE rests on a foundation with four core components:

•   People First
•   Principles of Systems Theory
•   Elements of Jay Abraham's Strategy of Preeminence
•   Strategic Upstream Decisions

People First

understanding people is far more important than interpreting click rates, open rates, and other metrics

your audience's goals, problems, and desires have functional, social, and emotional dimensions which creates opportunities to create more engaging experiences for your readers — *pulling* them forward rather than pushing them along.

Some of those people will want to buy from you immediately.

Most of your audience who will eventually become customers — 85% by Dean Jackson's estimate — won't buy until after they've been in your world for several months.

Principles of Systems Theory

**No single email, email campaign, or marketing message is responsible for results**.

The Strategy of Preeminence

> The Strategy of Preeminence demands that from this moment forward, you see yourself in the relationship you have with your clients as their most trusted advisor, counsel, confidant, in the field of endeavor, in the area of expertise, and the outcome area that your product or service produces in their life or in their business.

> You want to be seen from now on by everyone you deal with as the definitive expert source, and the most trusted advisor, and as a fiduciary — as someone who has taken on the responsibility of their governance, their decisions, their best interests, as their most trusted counsel.

The shift in perspective that follows adoption of the Strategy of Preeminence is profound. You'll begin to habitually look for ways to create more *value* for your audience (which will create, in return, more value for you).

you'll see yourself and the value you create as the definitive best option

Strategic Upstream Decisions

“I don't want to be a great problem solver. I want to avoid problems—prevent them from happening and doing it right from the beginning.” — [Peter Bevelin](https://fs.blog/intellectual-giants/peter-bevelin/) (Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger)

Your friend answers, ‘I'm going upstream to tackle the guy who's throwing all these kids in the water.'

whole lot of decisions that look like different decisions are really part of the same category of a decision

•   Emphasize relationships *before* transactions.
•   Treat *everyone* like a customer, regardless if money has changed hands, because customers are created before they buy anything.
•   Build attractive worlds for your audience to *inhabit*.
•   Ask for *explicit* permission before sharing promotions.
