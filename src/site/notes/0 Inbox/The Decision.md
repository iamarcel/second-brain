Have you made The Decision? What it all comes down to?
I will do my absolute best to be a happy human.
This is the true start to any kind of success.
But it needs to come from deeply within. A core part of who you are.

It's one of Tony Robbins' main messages:

> It is in our moments of decision that our lives are made.

I know, it sounds stupidly simple. But at some level this is all that matters—and one other thing: remembering.

If we can't remember to take our keys with us when we leave the house, why would we even dare to think we'll perfectly remember our intention to, say, be kind and patient towards others?

If you have Decided, you'll quickly realize that—because you now *really want it*—you'll have to put in work. And one of the core challenges is making sure you remember what you decided.

It's why we read Twitter.
It's why we keep journals.
It's why we follow Instagram quote accounts.
It's why we write the same goals over and over again.
