**The awakened feminine is always in service to your true nature.** Even when she triggers every cell in your being and you perceive her as a threat.

The nature of the feminine is to expose the shadow. She is a liberator of the truth, of the soul. Do not allow your shadow to turn her into the enemy, instead feel and see the love behind what she does and everything will change.
