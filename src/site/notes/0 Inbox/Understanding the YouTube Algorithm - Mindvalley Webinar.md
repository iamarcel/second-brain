# Introduction
Superhumans at Work.

Your fear of success might be bigger than you fear of failure.

He's an advisor for the presenter: already 1000 subscribers.

Taget: people under 100 or 1000 subs.

## Why YouTube
YouTube is the only platform where your content stays relevant for a long time. All the other platforms punish you if you're not creating every day.

When you sync up with YouTube, it's evergreen. I love YouTube.

# Fear
Don't try to be perfect. Actually that creates a *wall*.

What's great and relatable is people who have a personality. If they crack a joke it's great—even if it's a bad joke.

**The Decision: I'm going to make a YouTube channel and I'll be here for the long haul.**

Making perfect videos doesn't exist. Creating perfect videos *shouldn't* happen because it creates a disconnect.

# About Algorithms
The algorithms model the people. So once you know how to speak to people, yo know how to create content.

Create a top-down funnel.
- Make something that people need in their life at this point & optimize it for search
- Chop it up for other social media

# The Rules of the Game
On YT:
1. Clicks
2. Watch time

What to make:
- Clickable thumbnails
- Clickable titles
- People watch for minutes and minutes

What type of content to create?
- Understand your niche
- Understand who's currently in your niche, what's working for them, what isn't
- Go on a recon as a detective, look at what people are doing right and what they're doing wrong
	- Length
	- Type
	- Popularity
	- Look for globally popular + breakout popular things in the last few weeks (because videos might have been popular *years* ago)

# It takes too much time
- 1 weekend per month for planning
- Monday morning, shoot the videos for the next month
- Pass it to editors, automate and schedule upload

# Learning
Don't release all at once. But if you're *starting out*, film once a week so you can practice more and improve every time.

There's no way to learn your style until you start making things.

Give yourself permission to look like a fool in the video. It's going to happen no matter what.

Bare minimum: one video a week. Length can be whatever you're comfortable with. Anything less than that, you're not compressing timeframes enough. You're not learning enough. Two is good, three is max (for beginners).

# Research & Recon: How?
The internet gurus is a tricky subject. You have to be careful who you listen to.

Use this guideline: **What videos do you like watching?**
- Why do you keep watching?
- Why did you stop watching after 30 seconds?
- How did they get you to keep watching?

The catch-22 is: you won't actually like until you do it.
- Andrew Huberman likes 3 hour podcasts
- Some people like 60 second shorts
Go try some things and see what you enjoy.

Example: presenter looked at Future Unity — had great titles and thumbnails that made him click, but the actually video sucked. (This would be punished by the algorithm.)

First 30 seconds matter.

The more you know at your topic + the better you are, the easier it's gonna be.

**It's really important that people can tell within 30 seconds you know what you're talking about.**

Make sure: whatever you're talking about, you know what you're talking about.

# How to find people?
- Make things people are interested in.
- Be consistent.

# Trust
You need to gain the trust of YouTube first.

This is why your heart and mind need to be in the right place.

Then let time do its thing. Get better. The rest will take care of itself. There's no set amount of time.

One view is better than zero. 1000 people, that's a *lot*!

# Introduction graphics?
In truth, nobody cares.

The first 30 seconds are *really really important*. So take out the montage.

As soon as I click the video, I want to be sure that this is why I clicked, in the first 1 second. I want to know you're the right person within 30 seconds, so I know if I need to continue watching. Around 60 seconds, you can reassure people, give credentials etc.

# Delete old stuff?
You want people to get **familiar** with you. If it's totally different from what I liked you for before, it's weird.

Think about: people knowing they can depend on you for certain answers.

# Entertainment
Comedy and entertainment are good to lead with.
