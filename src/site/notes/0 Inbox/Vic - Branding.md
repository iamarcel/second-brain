**3 layers of problems**

If you have a problem but no distraction, you won’t take action to solve the problem.

Deeper layers are more important:
1. External problem
2. That causes internal frustration
3. And it feels philosophically wrong, “I should…” not beliefs this

Know the problem better than your audience. “Wow if he knows the problem so well he must know the solution”
You turn a desire into a need.

### 3 core brand messages
The bridge between the two

1. Message that reminds people what could be like (lifestyle)
2. Emotional: create tension. Filter out people who disagree. Strong opinions.
3. Remind them we are the brand that represents their vision.

The threshold for trust in personal brand is different. You can’t be trusted without a polarizing message.

Stay consistent and creative.

Don’t change the message but keep it fresh.
