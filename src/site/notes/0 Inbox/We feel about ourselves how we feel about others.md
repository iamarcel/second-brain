**Our feelings about ourselves tend to correspond to our feelings about other people.** When someone begins to feel more compassion about others, he invariably begins to feel more compassion toward himself.

If you don't feel important, stop judging others.
To stop feeling guilt, stop condemning other people in your own mind.
