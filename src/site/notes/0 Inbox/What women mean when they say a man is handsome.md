His arc of emotional expression is narrow, his smiles infrequent, and this is oddly reassuring.

He has a tantalising honesty that can be felt as surprising and unexpected in a sea of agreeing head-nodders. He says what no one else is saying. He says little when everyone else is talking.

He appears to be a central influence to the people around him, able to inspire others to feel at ease; to relax, without words. He’s not afraid to physically touch.

He seems disinterested in drawing attention to his accomplishments or his material possessions. He may wear a chunky watch, but it’s like he has nothing to prove, nothing to protect, and nothing to lose.

There’s a current of energy running through him and a sparkle in his eye — perhaps it reflects his mission, one that keeps him busy and frustratingly unavailable. He rarely responds to her text immediately.

Regardless of his light-heartedness, there is an indescribable aspect to him that speaks of an intimacy with a darker part of his nature.

He doesn’t change for anyone, including women.

Just his calm, light-hearted self. But others, interestingly enough, are often compelled to want to change for him.
