# Components
## Start by writing the body
It should add a very specific value.

### Headers and white space
Use tweet headers.
Use enough white space, not too much.

## The Scroll-Stopper
Create a *Curiosity Gap* by raising a question in the reader's head.

- Say what they'll get and address an objection
- Use eye-catching numbers
- Use juxtaposition
- Get right to the point

## Set the Table
In the first Tweet, raise the stakes and make the audience even *more* curious.

## Use Transitional Messages (per-tweet cliffhanger)
Always end one tweet with a transition to the next one, so the reader stays on edge.

## Surprise
Lead the reader down one path, then surprise them with a different turn of events.

## End with a Lesson and a CTA

# Formatting
People overlook large chunks of text.
The visual appeal of a tweet matters.

## Examples

List of *here's what you'll learn*. Single line per item, no dots. Add line breaks to long lines.

### Do This Not That
❌ don't do this

✅ do that, short and simple

Explain reasoning below.

## Comparing
Two items, each with some sub-items. Make an interesting comparison, then wrap it up cleanly.

> Level vs. Trajectory
> 
> The work:
> -> Every team has problems
> -> Add them up clearly to know the state
> 
> The people:
> -> You don't need performance at your target level
> -> Don't confuse "getting better" with "what's needed"
> 
> Judgement is the job.
>
> So ask: when will the gap close fast enough?

## "How to" double bullet list
Quick explanation of how to start.
Three bullet points
Then level up:
Three other bullet points
Assert the benefit a bit longer.
# Question Checklist
## Does the hook grab my attention?
Most people are mindlessly scrolling. Hook in the first sentence.

- Questions
- Numbers
- Unfinished thoughts ("unpopular opinion" or just don't finish a sentence)

## Can I simplify the language?
Simplest isn't always best but for Twitter, it is.

## Can I focus the point?
One point per tweet. One. Only one.

Read your tweet and ask yourself “What is my main point?” Then delete everything else.

## Can I make it relatable?
Most important is that the audience says "yes that is me."

## Can I make it flow?
Every sentence flows to the next.
Break up a pattern only at the end.
Make the conclusion wrap up the rest.

## Is it punchy?
Get rid of nuance. The world is full of it but with 280 characters and 10ms you have no choice.

Nuance across the timeline, not in the tweet.

Hit the point hard.

## Is it concrete?
Specific brands, smells, pictures.

## Does it sing?
Does it *feel* like a work of art?

Spend more time reading poetry than Twitter.
