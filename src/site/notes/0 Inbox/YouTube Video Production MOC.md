# Create Intrigue.
This is the main principle for everything.

# Click-Through Rate
## Thumbnails
Do not show the title.
Create hints to the content, evoke questions.

## Titles
Use power words.
Don't make it long, people won't read it.

# Increasing retention
- When listing out things, don't say the clue first. People will stop watching.
- At the end cards, explain why they should watch another specific video you made. Create an invisible transition to the next video instead of "another point."
- Smile! People smile in return and that releases dopamine.
- Set up stakes. **Start the video with a challenge** to yourself. Could be very small, just losing time or face when it fails. Or more: getting other people involved and doing a forfeit if you fail.

# Creativity
Yes, copy what works. But you'll get bored if you keep doing it. Practice creativity too and try new things. When you try new things you can't lose because you learn from it. Every 5th or 6th video, create a wildcard.
