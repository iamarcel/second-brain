# Create Intrigue.
This is the main principle for everything.

# Click-Through Rate
## Thumbnails
Do not show the title.
Create hints to the content, evoke questions.

## Titles
Use power words.
Don't make it long, people won't read it.

# Retention
When listing out things, don't say the clue first. People will stop watching.
At the end cards, explain why they should watch another specific video you made.
