Please do not escape when you’re at your lowest point. That is when you learn the most.

Examine if your top of mind is what you want or what you don’t want. You will attract that energetically.

You were born with a gift of persistence. As a baby and a kid you kept trying.

Make sure you have a vision. One that’s audacious. One that makes you giddy when you wake up. Don’t make it any smaller.

Don’t keep changing your mind. It’s like asking the waiter that is the universe and calling them back to change all the time.
