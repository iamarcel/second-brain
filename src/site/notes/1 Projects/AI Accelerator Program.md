## The Big Domino
Leveraging AI and high-tech tools in their business can save significant time and bring about transformative efficiency. If they believe this, all other objections (cost, learning curve, skepticism about AI) become irrelevant.

**Understanding and implementing AI in your business isn't just advantageous, it's essential for scaling and thriving in the digital age.**

AI and automations are the best way you can free up your time and bring back joy in your business, and the AI Accelerator is the absolute best program to get you to understand and implement all of it.

## Format
Weekly live group calls to use AI and other high-tech tools in your business. Aimed at entrepreneurs, CEOs, solopreneurs, who can save *days* of their workweek.

## Example Benefits
- Cut writing time in half for copywriting & social media
- Centralize operational data to eliminate miscommunication and outdated information, spend less time managing a remote team
- Augment your creativity to accelerate your own processes and deliver better services
- Build your own mini-apps to streamline day-to-day tasks
- Create stunning, compelling imagery that convertsâ€”in less time than making your own footage or finding stock images
- Scale generative AI and create hundreds of individual posts or emails with a single click
- Get high-quality customer feedback in seconds instead of weeks
- Create your own business coaches and get specialized personal advice 24/7, for free
- Automate customer support with fully automated chatbots trained on your internal data
- Give students an individualized teacher based on your own course content
- Optimize articles for SEO and rank your website higher on Google
- Accelerate social media growth with more engaging content and storytelling
- Work through your specific use cases live and get inspired by other group members' cases

## Pricing
Weekly 2-hour live group calls.
Access to community where I and others answer questions.

â‚¬2997 for the 6 months program

VIP â‚¬4995
- Bi-weekly 1-hour 1-on-1 call

Team 20% discount 2-5 seats, 40% discount 5-10 seats.

Time saved framing: cost is â‚¬124 per week. If you charge â‚¬300 per hour, half an hour saved makes up for the cost. But you'll probably be saving 1-2 days, so that's almost a 1000% ROI.

> I was thinking, how low can I go with this price comparison? In my first job, straight out of university, I worked as technology advisor at KPMG. My time was â‚¬1K per day. Would this information have saved me one hour per week? Heck yeah! The more I think about this price, the more ridiculously low it becomes. But I'll keep it for now for the start of this program, if you can help me out with providing testimonials.

## The Offer
*How do I make this offer so incredible that people feel stupid for not getting it?*

- Weekly Calls: 2 hours group calls, interactive and live, for 6 months
- Copy-Paste AI Toolkit
	- Downloadable Make.com scenarios (see Sintra's stuff below)
	- Airtable setup with best practice basics data structure that businesses can adopt
	- The best frameworks I know, with a tool to implement them through a chatbot or through Airtable
- 24/7 Tech Support with a custom chatbot that knows the curriculum and has access to the most recent documentation of the tools we're using.
- 30 day money-back guarantee. So you can follow *four* sessions for free basically. If you think it's not saving you the time I promised, ask for your money back.

## The Stack
- The Program
	- Customer Support
		- â‚¬300K: Brussels fiscality chatbot
	- Lead Generation
		- What if you had 20% more leads because there's a chatbot
	- Social Media Automation
		- Coming up with ideas
		- Making shorts from long-form content
			- Full-on costs me 2h per short (and that's optimized for time)
			- With AI costs me more like 10 minutes
			- 5 shorts per week = 5 * 50 * 1.5h = â‚¬23,437.5
	- Operations / Wasting time
		- 1.6 hours per day looking for information = 100 per day = 20K per year (at 500 per day)
	- Learning
		- What if you could half your learning time for anything
	- Sales
		- Making templates & adapting to customers

# Collected notes from people

> My new Project was to try out Airtable to get the basis for automation and organization of my business. But honestly I'm already failing to import my client data into airtable. Does anyone have good ressources on how to get started with airtable.

> One of the biggest things I've been working on lately is automating twitter for 3 tweets a day everyday, with 1h of work a month for my clients. I'm still stitching the details on that.
>
> I'm also working on a document for my team on using AI

> Not sure if this is what you are looking for - I use Agorapulse to create, work with my team and publish to all of my social media platforms. It now has an AI built in feature I have just started exploring to create the copy. 
>
> I can create one post for all of my channels and then go in and make edits to customize per platform if desired. I keep lists of hashtags so itâ€™s just one click to add relevant hashtags. It has all of the other bells and whistles you would expect from a top notch social media management tool. 
>
> They are on top of the AI and offer free workshops on how to integrate it into your company. I expect that they will be embedding more AI features soon.

# Attract audience through YouTube videos.

- How to automate content marketing with Airtable, GPT-4 and Zapier
	- Integrate Make
	- Image generation
		- Eden AI
	- Quote card generation
		- Placid
	- Secondary Goals
		- Show that I'm an AI consultant
			- The first part, figuring out the steps to take, is crucial. It sounds basic and obvious, but that's only because I've done the work. I understand the landscape of tools and how they can work together. I've investigated and vetted hundreds of AI and non-AI tools, been programming for 17 years and advising businesses in how to use it. I have the insights now and I can show you the way.
			- The second part, developing, is just executing the steps. That's what I'll show you step by step but maybe you just want to have your hands off and have someone else struggle through it. That's fine. At least you know *it's possible*.
		- Get people interested in AI Accelerator
			- If you're interested in saving hours, maybe even more than a day, per week by implementing AI and other high-tech tools, check out the webinar I'm hosting. I teach businesses how to implement AI and when it compounds, oh baby it's so much fun. Because you can focus on what really matters to you, all the rest is easy and automated and just flows. I teach people online in groups where we all learn use cases from each other and I teach specific techniques or I help you figure out how to turn your challenges and ideas into reality. Even if you're not a programmer.

# Ideas & Notes

- Give Make.com template pack as one of the stack items when selling this
- Give predefined Airtable setup that works seamlessly with my Make.com pack
- Interview [[Carolina\|Carolina]] about how she changed her business by systematizing it
	- SOPs
	- Automations
	- Instagram automation
- Two types of YouTube videos: inspirational, pulling a wider less-technical beginner-friendly audience of business ownersâ€”then more hands-on showing that I know what I'm doing.
- Interview Danny too when he has set it up
- I can build Tanya's CV bot easily with a Vercel template and not caring so much about reusability. Hide a chatbot behind a paywall and boom done.
- Vishen said: 85% of the work in AI is feeding it the right data. I put *everything* in Airtable now. It's a simulation of my brain that my team can access. It saves 1 day a week but you got to put in the work. You have to be an effective executive.
