Team 20% discount 2-5 seats, 40% discount 5-10 seats.

Time saved framing: cost is €124 per week. If you charge €300 per hour, half an hour saved makes up for the cost. But you'll probably be saving 1-2 days, so that's almost a 1000% ROI.

> I was thinking, how low can I go with this price comparison? In my first job, straight out of university, I worked as technology advisor at KPMG. My time was €1K per day. Would this information have saved me one hour per week? Heck yeah! The more I think about this price, the more ridiculously low it becomes. But I'll keep it for now for the start of this program, if you can help me out with providing testimonials.

# Collected notes from people

> My new Project was to try out Airtable to get the basis for automation and organization of my business. But honestly I'm already failing to import my client data into airtable. Does anyone have good ressources on how to get started with airtable.

> One of the biggest things I've been working on lately is automating twitter for 3 tweets a day everyday, with 1h of work a month for my clients. I'm still stitching the details on that.
>
> I'm also working on a document for my team on using AI

> Not sure if this is what you are looking for - I use Agorapulse to create, work with my team and publish to all of my social media platforms. It now has an AI built in feature I have just started exploring to create the copy. 
>
> I can create one post for all of my channels and then go in and make edits to customize per platform if desired. I keep lists of hashtags so it’s just one click to add relevant hashtags. It has all of the other bells and whistles you would expect from a top notch social media management tool. 
>
> They are on top of the AI and offer free workshops on how to integrate it into your company. I expect that they will be embedding more AI features soon.
