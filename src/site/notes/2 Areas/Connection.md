# Values
I deeply connect with the people around me.

We strive together, dine together and want to know the deepest parts of each other.

I specifically search for meeting with guys only as well.

Relations bring life to life.

**Honor the other.** Biggest fights are when you expect each other to be the same. Respect and elevate their individuality.

Anticipate things to make their life better.
What can you do tomorrow to make their day better?

Explicit communication is the most important in all of repair

Empathy = can they listen and not agree?

Love is a mode of being.

# Jordan Peterson handles bad-behaving people very well

Someone is asking him a "question" AKA attacking him, and these are things he says:

> It's hard to answer a question that ends with "your comments are benign" politely so I'd consider that more an opinionated personal and politival statement rather than a question. So why don't you try reformulating that so there's an actual question there?

> She: "Maybe it's about democracy actually being representative"
> He: "I don't understand your question"
> She: "Well no it's pretty obvious you don't sadly"
> He: "Well **how about you phrase it more clearly?** instead of just insulting me"

## Stay in love, as your *attitude towards the world*.


## You each need a social life of your own, and one together


## Praise and compliment 5 times more than negative feedback

## Why relationships fall apart

**Comfort.** We start believing that after putting in all our energy when first dating, we're done and it'll all go automatically from here on.
**Contempt.** We start thinking less of our partner.
**Violence.** This is mostly micro-aggressions. We lash out most to the ones we love the most.


## Monogamy

In only 60 years the way we see relationships has *completely* changed. From one partner for life and sex as a woman's duty, to now contraception making it something purely pleasurable.

The only reason to have sex after two kids now is because we both feel like it and desire each other.

In our culture we started expecting to be together with our soulmate, monogamously, and have desire for them for the rest of our lives; **and we're living twice as long.**

**Women get bored with monogamy much sooner than men.** That's been characterized earlier as "women are less interested in sex," but it's actually *women are less interested in the sex they can have.*

**Women want the *romance*.** The *pacing*, the teasing. The deep desire that builds up. Foreplay starts right after the previous orgasm.

## Sex ratio

High amount of men leads also to higher aggression in societies.

One of the universals of societies around the world is enforcing monogamy, which calms down society.
