# Why?
Two main drivers:
- Energy
- Beauty

First and most importantly, I want to be alive and energetic every day. I only want to be tired when the day has ended. There's a ton of things I want to do every day and I pay a lot of attention to making sure I can so it as well as possible.

With more energy comes:
- More work done (in less time)
- Better emotional regulation (I don't get angry or frustrated or feel down)
- Remembering more good habits
- Feeling better

Increasing my energy is my first go-to that kickstarts the "upwards spiral" of feeling good and better every day.

Secondly, I want to *look good*. I don't care how "selfish" that goal might be. I want to be fucking sexy. I want to look into the mirror and be proud when I'm naked, I want to be looked at and complimented by girls when they see me shirtless. Just like I value beauty in my interior, I value myself to be beautiful too.
