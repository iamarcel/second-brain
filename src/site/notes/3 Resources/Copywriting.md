Let's introduce a new style of writing called EPSW (Emotional Persuasive StoryWriting). Stories written in this style are highly emotional, forming a connection where the reader feels like they're in the shoes of the subject of the story, and have an emotional rollercoaster that goes to deep pain and then back up through a transformation. Finally, in the end it transitions to introducing some product or service that was responsible for the transformation.

The following principles are central to the EPSW writing approach:
- Write in a conversational and engaging tone.
- Write from the point of view of a writer writing a letter directly to the reader.
- Make it highly personal.
- Know the reader (audience) and understand their desires.
- Be clear and concise.
- Use words that evoke emotion and create desire.
- Provide evidence to support claims.
- Focus on the benefits.
- Be honest and trustworthy.
- Use powerful visuals.
- Don't be loud and flashy.
- Respect the intelligence of your reader.
- Use short bits of unexpected humor to lighten the mood and keep the reader engaged.
- Always tell stories. Story, story, story.

Content in the EPSW writing style follows this structure:

- An eyebrow, short pre-heading text that calls out the type of reader specifically
- A headline that immediately grabs attention and creates curiosity, because it creates a few questions in the reader's mind. This should be a counterintuitive statement.
- A subheading that hints at the transformation induced by the product or service at the end
- Now the main body of the text starts, and it uses a storytelling-based approach throughout the text. Both longer stories and shorter anecdotes.
- The body starts off by connecting the reader with a deep pain they feel. It relates the pain or frustration to them with a story or anecdote, and spells out the internal train of thought the protagonist has.
- The protagonist thinks more about their pain and relates it to the big, important areas in their life. Things like their happiness, relationships, health, wealth. They exacerbate this pain and internal negative train of thought.
- Now, the text transitions to educating the reader. It helps them understand why they feel this way, and gives surprising or unconventional ideas and principles. This shows that the writer truly understands the struggles and frustrations.
- If possible, the letter helps justify these feelings of the reader, acknowledges them and shows the reader indirectly that it's not their fault. It refers to external factors that are the blame.
- At this point, a story of transformation begins. It could be from the point of view of the writer, or from someone else. In this story, the pains mentioned before are slowly being resolved and removed. During this story there are subtle hints at the final solution, but probably it paints a picture of how the product or service was created.
- At the end of the transformation is a moment of reflection on all the previous pains and fears. There is a reflection on the big, important areas in life again and a realization that all the problems have been resolved. This paints an image of a wonderful future in a perfect world.
- Now there's an explanation of how the product or service made this transformation possible, and why this specific product or service is unique. It transitions to an offer, and ends with a strong call to action.

In terms of formatting, keep these guidelines in mind:
- Always write in Markdown format
- Throughout the entire text, annotate in *italics*: which part of the structure is written below and its purpose
- Add subheadings that tell a story by themselves and summarize the larger text, enticing the reader to continue reading.
