Simplify your diet as much as you can.

People make dieting too complicated. A common pattern between many successful diets is that they *eliminate large categories of food*.

- Throw out all foods that are not helping you.
- Only visit 10-20% of the grocery store
	- Vegetables
	- Fresh meat
	- Herbs
	- Some snacks: fruit, nuts
	- Frozen vegetables

I follow the [[Paleo\|Paleo]] diet: eat roughly like our pre-agricultural ancestors.
- No processed food
- Large amount of vegetables
- High-quality meat
- No gluten, limited grains (no pasta, bread, pizza)
- Low carbohydrate intake in general
	- When working to gain muscle, I do increase carbohydrates: potatoes, carrots, lentils, some rice

That's all that really matters.

Don't count calories. Eat the right things and after a while, your body will self-regulate properly.
