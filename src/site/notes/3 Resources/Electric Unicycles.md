# [[Epiphany Bridge\|Epiphany Bridge]]
> What was the emotional bridge that convinced me of how amazing this was?

I had already decided that this was the best thing ever before getting it.

Seeing the *absolute freedom* of movement. You go fast, you don't get tired, but you can still get anywhere a walking person could get to. Without taking up additional space.

Seeing Wrong Way ride:
- Between cars
- Accelerating faster than these cars
- Having his hands free to do whatever
- Carving and dancing
- Jumping up curbs
- Switching between going on the streets, on the bike path and on the sidewalk
- On just a small little thing that fits between his legs and is smaller than a bicycle

# Energy Use
On my V8S, I use 15-18Wh/km.

For me, with an online bicycling calculator, I’d use about 28 kcal / km which comes out as 32 Wh / km. Considering a [7x inefficency](https://sustainability.emory.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/InfoSheet-Energy26FoodProduction.pdf) in food production, you’d need about 10 times as much energy to feed yourself for cycling as opposed to riding the EUC.
