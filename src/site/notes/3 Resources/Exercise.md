# Principles of Exercise
With the right exercise, you only need a little bit to stay healthy.

The main goal of exercise is to **maintain muscle**, especially as you get older. The older you get, the more important strength training becomes.

**Cardio training is not optimal.** It takes a lot of time and (comparatively) doesn't burn a lot of calories. After *strength* training, the body needs to recover which uses a lot of energy, and afterwards the new muscle burns more energy even when you're doing nothing.

# The Cornerstones
- As much as possible low-grade movement
	- Stand up from your desk every 25 minutes
	- Take the stairs when you have the option
	- Walk with every opportunity you have
		- You're not wasting time if your travel time takes longer but you exercise in the meantime
- Use [[4 Archive/Notes/Free Workouts\|Free Workouts]]
	- Take the bike to grocery shopping. You're shopping anyways but now there's a workout included!
	- Do manual labor in the garden. You're cleaning up plus moving!
	- Help friends out when they're moving.
- Short bouts of high-intensity exercise
	- The higher the intensity, the shorter the exercise can be
	- [[Body By Science\|Body By Science]] (book) explains a 15 minute-a-week hyper-efficient workout: 5 exercises each, heavy weights on a machine, move them slowly for as long as you can. Should be so heavy that you need to give up after 1 minute 30. Increase the weights every week (unless you fail after less than 1 minute).
	- [[Stronglifts 5x5\|Stronglifts 5x5]] is roughly what I do now. Strength training with a barbell. This trains more of the body as a whole, and I like these exercises more than the machine exercises of Body By Science.
