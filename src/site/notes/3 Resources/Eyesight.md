# How to fix eyesight
- Get glasses one level lower than prescribed (0.25 less strong). Your eyesight fluctuates and you anchor to your glasses strength.
- Get an eyesight chart and hang it on the wall.
- Practice focusing, from easy to hard.
- Sleep in a pitch-black room (nearsightedness)
- Hire a vision coach / get a vision course
	- Don't get obsessed with the Bates method, but there's 90 years of modern research
