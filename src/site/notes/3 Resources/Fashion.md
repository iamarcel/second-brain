# Technical Fabrics
## Schoeller Dryskin
-   **Feel:** Stretchy, highly comfortable. Pretty soft.
-   **Performance:** Water-resistace: Nylon stops water ingress.
-   **Durability:** water resistance will lose effectiveness over time. High-traffic areas get some fading.
-   **Style:** has some structure but also drapes a bit.

Sound analysis: deep, coarse.

## Stotz etaproof
-   **Feel:** Cotton-derived. Much more hard-wearing, rigid, structured, outerwear. No stretch. “Smooth feel but not soft.”
-   **Performance:** Water resistance: DWR treating stops some water, rest is absorbed, makes fibres thicker and prevents further ingress. Breathability: has some stuff to protect in direct sunlight. Has some abraision reistance.
-   **Durability:** water resistance will sta
-   **Style:** straight, a bit like raw denim. Angular shapes stand out a bit more.

Sound analysis: crispy.


## Twill (Enfin Leve technical Twil)

-   **Feel:** Very comfortable indoors. Feels more like a pair of track bottoms. A little bit of give.
-   **Performance:** Water resistance: a mix that’s a bit less than Dryskin and etaproof.
-   **Style:** much less structured appearance, drapes down.

Sound analysis: soft, natural.
