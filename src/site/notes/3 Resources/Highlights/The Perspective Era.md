Do you feel it?
- The constant pressure to consume information 24/7
- The feeling to have to make use of *every single minute*
- The fear that there's always *something better* you could be doing with your time
These are signs that the attention era is coming to a close. There is no left.

The most valuable thing you can do, is to share your story in a way that you can start building on top of it.

Perspective means holistic understanding.

Perspective includes *wisdom*, awareness of our own emotions and values.

We feel like we're being flooded with information.
What do people do in a flood? They *seek the high ground*. They search for overview.
