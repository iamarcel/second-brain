Best to ask a few friends to help out a month beforehand.
Having 4 days to pack and clean everything is great.

Before the move and friends are invited, the owner best:
- Cleans up
- Throws away as many things as possible (otherwise stuff you don't want anymore will be moved)
- At least sorts things that should be packed together

In a first stage pack everything into boxes, second stage is moving things.

When you think you're done and there's just a few last things to do, still come with a large empty car. It will get filled with a ton of random stuff that doesn't stack well.

Get snacks and drinks for everyone.
Make sure the people are fed well.

Having fun:
- When there are enough people, take breaks.
- I think it would be great to factor in breaks just spending quality time together or even playing games or something.
- Assign someone the responsibility of taking care of food, music and breaks. This can really be a dedicated person. Give them your card.

The owner's most important job is *deciding* and they are the bottleneck because they're the only one that knows: keep / throw away? Where to package it? This is why:
- The owner spending time before packing and trashing is great
- The owner should try to delegate as much as possible

Organizing:
- Have a shared whiteboard or something to track progress on and so everyone knows the order of things.
