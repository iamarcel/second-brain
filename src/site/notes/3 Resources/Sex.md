# Sexual Performance
I've always been complimented on my performance in bed—even from my first time (which I didn't believe back then, but got to over time as I collected more "data points"). So either I'm genetically gifted, the ton of research I'd done the years before having sex or my upbringing implicitly brought me wisdom for in bed.

## Pleasuring Women
What do I feel is the most important for giving your girlfriend a "wow" effect? Number one is **pay attention**. Listen to her moaning, feel her, smell her. Notice the effect of everything you do. You can play around with it and learn that way—different women get off from different things.

If you find something that works, just keep going at the same pace. We guys are used to upping intensity when it's good but it doesn't work the same way for women.

Start slow. Tease a lot. I have a lot of fun going so slowly that she's begging for me to keep going. And the orgasms after that are great.

A girl's first orgasm is hardest. You can let her cool down a little bit and then go back in for another orgasm.

The tip of the clitoris (the pointy part that sticks out and you can see) is very sensitive. Great place to stimulate but be careful not to overdo it. Even "two hairs" of pressure, when done long enough, can make her cum. Many women's clit is hidden underneath a "hood," you can often (but not always) pull it away by pushing up with your thumb and exposing the clit itself.

## Male Endurance
For a long time I've gotten to the point of no return too soon in my opinion. I've definitely learned how far I can go, how to back off, slowing down and ramping back up. That way I can have sex for a long time. And it's very satisfying for my partner as I'm great at fellatio. But still I'd like to keep going for longer when I'm really hammering hard.

I have abstained from masturbating a lot over the years, from the supposed nofap benefits. I do feel that not ejaculating gives me more drive—drive to get a girl that I can redirect to work. That's great.

But maybe completely abstaining hurt my endurance. So I'll try the opposite now: endurance training. I can still make sure I don't ejaculate, but masturbate a lot.

One great idea for going down on her: while you're doing it, she closes her eyes and you whisper in her ears what you love about her and how she makes you feel.

## Penis Enlargement
I have an above-average penis but this still interests me—even if just for the lulz. Enlarging your penis, I don't know, it feels like it's a joke so I'd have a good internal laugh if I can pull it off.

I'm much more interested in girth than length. I've been too long before and it's not fun—she's worried that I will hurt her and if I go hard it does actually hurt (and not in the good way).

From the little bit of research I've done:
- Do jelqing: with 50%-80% hardness, make an O with your thumb and index finger, and pull blood to the hood (not over it) over 2-3 seconds. Repeat 100-200 times. Repeat 4 times per week. Repeat for multiple years.
- Penis weights or stretching devices.

What matters is, of course, blood flow. That and micro-tears in the tissue so more builds up—just like muscle building.

I'm just starting on this and it'll take months if not years to see results, but 1 or 2cm of length or girth would be a lot for me.

Don't wear tight-fitting underwear. I've noticed that loose underwear causes me to have more (semi-) erections during the day. That's actually a good sign. So I'll transition to that type of underwear now.
