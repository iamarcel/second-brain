# macOS: Mixing Microphone and PC input
- Install BlackHole
- In the MIDI Controller app, create a virtual Output device that's both your speakers / headphones *and* BlackHole
- In the System Preferences, set the default output device to this new virtual one you created
- Start up Garageband, create a recording track and turn on monitoring (the little WiFi-ish symbol). In the settings, choose the microphone as input and BlackHole as output for the monitoring
- Now, use the BlackHole input wherever you want the mixed audio to appear.

In video calls, make sure you set the output to *only your speakers*, else they will hear an echo as their output is going back into your input.
