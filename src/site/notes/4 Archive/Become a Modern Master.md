# Ongoing Thoughts
## Breathwork Insight
All I need to do is:
- Practice trust
- Make a plan
- Get a coach

## How do I [[0 Inbox/Pursue the ignored path\|Pursue the ignored path]]?
Set up an offer structure that is unique, honest, progressive, and makes me a ton of money. Obsidian Vault, Plans / Courses, Text message accountability, group coaching, 1-on-1 coaching. Seamless path of "yeah I want the stuff this guy presents."

This requires ongoing great organization from my side. Structuring me becoming a Renaissance Man and sharing it well.

I have a unique combination of competencies in being able to code + having this storytelling / public speaking / teaching capacity. The really Big Guys are trying to build an app but I can out-innovate them. Give people exactly what they need instead of just recommending courses or whatever. The precise pathway.

What if my code and content are intertwined?

- Create Vault to be shared with subscribers
- Set up Journeys and link to upsells
- Upsell could be consulting to find a path

I don't want top down categorization. It should feel like this infinite source of wisdom, almost overwhelming, with the joy of exploring encyclopedia. Then to chart a path, tools that build a Journey, and track progress.

- Become the wise grandpa of a million people
- "We just got a baby and decided to use your vault as a framework for how we will tech him about life."

Biggest challenge: I don't like organizing.

This is the most optimal use of my time. Selling my vault is literally taking 100% of what I can from what I'm writing. This is the starting point of other content.

- Vault
	- Votes on pages
- Themed cohorts
- Group with scheduled live sessions on topics
- Upsell to a learning path
- Upsell to accountability
- Accountability levels until 1-1 coaching

# Support
## Visualizations
I'm actually serving people. It's no longer about me, it no longer matters if I'm comfortable. It matters that I serve these people.
