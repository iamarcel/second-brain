Read book: [[4 Archive/Imported/Building a Second Brain\|Building a Second Brain]]

Hoping [[4 Archive/Notes/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] will be nicer than Emacs:
- App support
- Much easier to add images
- Built-in syncing
- Both folders and tags, so I can have an inbox where I review stuff

This tool is very very fast, itâ€™s great. Everything appears basically instantly.
The random note tool is also *nice*.
