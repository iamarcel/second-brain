# Main keys


## ****Master the fundamentals.**** Get to the ****no-thinking zone****. You need to create photos at a very high level, <span class="underline"><span class="underline">consistently.</span></span> Have your ****signature style****.


## To be perfect, ****practice perfectly.****


### Regular instruction from a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">master</span></span>


### Learning is <span class="underline"><span class="underline">two-way communication</span></span> (think of martial arts)


### The 10 000-hour rule is the beginning.


## ****Be relevant.**** You’ll have to evolve, reinvent, innovate. The photographers that don’t regularly reinvent themselves, will eventually fail.


### You don’t have to immediately “lose your style,” but every year you can change up your style a bit.


# Continuing to evolve


## Want to earn more? Evolve.


## Know more skills: wedding, portraits, lighting.


## Learn ****what you can bring to the industry****.


## ****Passion & Desperation.**** There’s a point at which you have to be <span class="underline"><span class="underline">desperate</span></span> in some sense before you finally do what you have to do. ****The world will keep throwing excuses at you.****


### Not enough time


### Not enough money


### Not the right situation


### Not enough success (guess what, you’ll fail a lot and you learn from your failures)


## Passion is necessary because it gives hope when the results are disappointing


# ****Taking risk**** to be successful


## This is huge.


## Technical aspects are <span class="underline"><span class="underline">easy</span></span> compared to risk.


## Our life is already filled to the brim and now we want to <span class="underline"><span class="underline">add</span></span> something?


## So <span class="underline"><span class="underline">risk</span></span> is letting go of the familiar in order to add something new.


# Marketing & Business Don’ts


## Great marketing + average skill is better than average marketing + great skill.


## ****Right now there’s a person with half your ability earning 10x more than you.****


## There are two types of entrepeneurs: <span class="underline"><span class="underline">interpid</span></span> and <span class="underline"><span class="underline">organizer</span></span>. You have to be both.


# Business mistakes


## ****Underestimating work required.****


## ****Underestimating time it takes to start photography business.****


### 9/10 times, taking one year isn’t enough


### Prepare to invest years of hard work before you can do it


### Scott’s story: worked 12 years for 10K/year


## ****Not enough person-to-person interaction.****


### Photography is a social skill.


### You will be found and known through other people.


### Shoot once a week—even if it’s a freebie.


### Skill is more valuable than knowledge.


### Working will bring in more jobs. If you’re not out there, you won’t get more work.


### Free work is marketing.


### ****Learn to be social, it’s good marketing.****


## ****Networking is not a priority.****


### Often go out and talk with other people.


### Add value to someone’s business. If you can do that, they’ll hire you.


### ****Photographers are a good source of business.**** 30% of your business if you’re starting can be from \_<sub>other</sub> photographers\_\_—so get into a community.


### Major photo conventions are a ****must****.


## ****Not seeking expert advice.****


### Once you start losing money, it goes fast. So <span class="underline"><span class="underline">find a coach</span></span>.


### A good mentor can double your income quickly.


### Expert advice is the best way to start growing your business.


# Financial goal breakdown


## This is to set a goal and make sure you do something about it.


## Determine your realistic annual income goal.


## Determine your revenue streams


## Determine how many jobs to book


## Turn that into weekly or monthly goals so you can track how you’re doing.


## Create marketing plans for each revenue stream


## Reach out when it’s not going well


# Social media branding


## This is to make money


## Be uniquely you


## Be an expert at what you market. Give expert advice. (Okay if that’s not the case at the beginning.)


## ****Move people emotionally.**** Every sale is through an emotional response.


## ****Use video.****


## Be sincere.


## Be consistent. Post regularly.


## Reciprocate: comment back if someone comments on your post.


## Get on all platforms and see what works best for you.


# Mentors


## Just reach out. ****There are people out there willing to help out.****
