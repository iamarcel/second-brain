# Brightness


## In video, generally, nothing touching 0%, only lights directly into the camera for example touching 100%. Still everything close to 0% and 100%.

# Color balance


## Use scopes to prevent eyes getting used to the wrong color


# Correct a video as a whole. Apply styles on a second pass (best is on a separate adjustment layer).
