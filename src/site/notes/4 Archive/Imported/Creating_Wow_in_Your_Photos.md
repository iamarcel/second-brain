# Basic Rules


## Subject is brightest


### Eliminate hot spots in other places


### Always be conscious of the background


### Bind background where subject would be brighter


### Test: underexpose and see what remains


### You can get away without this, e..g, when the other elements are working, or there’s a bright rim light


## Subject is sharpest


## Subject is largest


### This is one of the hardest things for new photographers to do


## Subject is contrasting (e.g, silhouette)


### When rim light is bright instead of the actual subject, that works too


## Color


### Look at the wardrobe of your subject and try to find contrasting colors in the environment


### A colorful environment creates interesting image


# In Practice


## Find areas of darkness. Put your subject slightly in there so they’re still lighted.


## You can use a white umbrella as a simple reflector on a stand, even without using a flash in it.


## If your camera is in auto mode, you can’t do a low key image


## If your viewer is taking half a second to figure out what’s happening in the shot, it’s not an impactful photo. Clean up the photo, make your subject the largest.


## When you get closer to the subject, the bokeh gets bigger.


## Expose silhouettes so you can still see some detail in the subject


## When making a silhouette, make a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">shape</span></span>.
