> **Digital minimalism** is a philosophy that helps you question what digital communication tools (and behaviors surrounding these tools) add the most value to your life. It is motivated by the belief that intentionally and aggressively clearing away low-value digital noise, and optimizing your use of the tools that really matter, can significantly improve your life.

# Solitude

Being alone was probably one of [[4 Archive/Notes/Lincoln\|Lincoln]]’s most important practices.

Solitude is important and everyone who avoids it for a longer period of time will eventually suffer.

-   **Solitude:** a subjective state where your mind is free from external inputs.

You can find solitude in "unexpected" places such as a busy coffee shop and, the other way around, you can lose solitude very quickly when isolated from the rest of the world by talking to someone, reading a book or listening to a podcast.

> All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.

Benefits of solitude:

-   New ideas
-   An understanding of the self
-   Closeness to others

> “I am here alone for the first time in weeks, to take up my ‘real’ life again at last.”
