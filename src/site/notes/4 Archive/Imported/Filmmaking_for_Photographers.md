# Setup


## Stills cameras have much more megapixels than needed for video. So cameras use a variety of methods to reduce the pixels: skipping, binning, cropping, or downsampling. You don’t want cropping.


## If you want some pan or tilt in your video you need a fluid head instead of a photo tripod.


## Checking balance on a fluid head: you want it to stay still when you let go, and have the center of gravity in the right place.


## External recorders often have an advantage because often external recording has a higher quality. If you can both record internally and externally, that’s preferred.


## Default shooting is in 8 bits. 10 bits gives you 1024 per tone, 12 bit 4096 bits per tone. B-frame compression is bidirectional prediction; P-frame predicts forward; I-frame doesn’t predict, it’s the best looking image and edits faster but larger size.


## Chroma subsampling lunminance:red:blue. Most are 4:2:0. 4:2:2 has a second row of red/blue colors. In any case, it’s now much more important to get the right exposure when shooting.


## Key filter is a variable ND. You need it because the shutter speed is incredibly important. You must have these when there’s a lot of light.


## Generally we reuse lenses. Biggest problem is focus: a very small throw (eg. 90 deg) so very hard to get critical focus. Follow-focus for big setups. Stills lenses breathe (look like zooming when focusing). Cinema lenses are also parfocal: focus doesn’t change when you change zoom.


## If you get zoom lenses, get a constant-aperture.


## Usually you don’t need the fastest cards, but sometimes you do. Bloom prefers smaller cards so less can go wrong. Cameras that can do simultaneous recording are great.


## Framerate depends on frequency of electricity supply, half of framerate is shutter speed.


## Log profile is very flat and good to keep dynamic range. Don’t do it in 8 bit, there’s not enough information. Bring digital sharpening down, you can do it in post. Bring contrast down also in 8 bit.


# Audio


## ****Establish sound sources**** in frame.


## Audio from microphones need to be amplified, that happens with the <span class="underline"><span class="underline">preamps</span></span>. Those in cameras are usually not that good, so best to use a recorder.


## Polar patterns


### Cardioid: heart-shaped, good all-round


### Supercardioid: like cardioid, a bit less from the side, a bit more in the back


### Supercardioid = shotgun: often held by a boom operator, aim at the heart


## Always use headphones


## Aim shotgun at the mic which reduces plosives and has some leeway for moving subjects


## Most stereo microphones have a strong front falloff, so not good for people


## Use a second audio track for redundancy: hide lav mic underneath clothes (pay attention to rustling clothes)


## Don’t use “auto” to set levels, don’t set them too high (overmodulation) or too low (lots of hiss).


### -9dB normal voice


### -6dB loud voice


### -14dB quiet voice


## Tip: use external recorder for main audio and stills cameras for B-roll only


## Recorder tips


### No MP3, use wav


### 16 bit


### 32GB SSD is enough for a day


### Keep recording scratch track in-camera to sync up in post


## Sound doesn’t have to be pristine, it should sounds real an in the environment


## When choosing the background, think of the audio as well. Aim your body in the right direction to block noise.


## ****Record a wild track**** of ambient sound of 30 seconds, so when you use clean sound you can add some of that non-clean background noise to make it sound consistent.


## ****Foley**** is overlayed sound. You can record afterwards in a studio, or do another take for visuals (with the microphone in frame)


## ****Sound is as important as the picture.****


## ****Exercise:**** Record a video and recreate audio in foley.


# Lighting


## The very best light is natural light, especially sunrise and sunset


## ****Three-point lighting****, the most fundamental lesson in lighting


### Key light: 45 degrees off to the side, big soft light. This angle is very dramatic, for a woman you’ll move it more to the front.


### Fill light: very soft, much softer light on the other side.


### Backlight: quite harsh light in the back, works very well on darker backgrounds


### When model is on the left of frame, light should come from his left


## Lighting for a story has no rules. We could fall back on three-point lighting but rarely use it because light is our way of expression.


## Position


### Three-quarter backlight creates mystery, common in film


### Full sidelight is very dramatic. Popular as it resembles light through a window.


### 1/4 key light position is “natural light


### Near fully flat is often used in beauty shoots


### Vertically frontal light is uncomfortable for talent, you can use it to resemble headlights for example


## Fill/background contrast ratio


### Key/fill ratio

1.  1:1 or 1:2 is common in comedy, females usually look better in less dramatic ratios

2.  One stop is half the light intensity


### Key/background ratio

1.  Generally, background is at least 1-2 stops less than background

2.  Human skintones tend to be in the middle gray area. There are brightness areas where it stands out, others where it’s sucked in


### Great practice technique (even doing it mentally as you watch films) is to recreate scenes’ lighting


## Lighting movement


### Move the light along with the camera: expensive, prevents changing light


### Work with the existing light and that only: be ahead of what’s going to happen, make the best of it, documentary style


### When you’re shooting wide, light doesn’t need to be perfect. ****In closeups it might be a good way to relight and add light.**** Just make sure the light is motivated.


### ****Don’t be afraid of different temperature lights.**** Warm light can be warm. E.g., night scene with 5600K moonlight that looks blue.


## Locations


### Check if the room works (often they won’t work immediately)


### When you start moving, take photos first so you can put it back exactly.


### When you see a nice wide shot, check if a tight shot works too.


### ****Be aware of the continuity of natural light.****


## Nighttime look


### Fake fire


### Warm light, white balance set to daylight


## Exteriors Day (high sun)


### With the sun straight on it’s harsh and hard for model


### Sub as backlight looks the most flattering


### You may need to flag the sun to avoid flares


### Worst weather is changing throughout time, often you then just want to take full control yourself. Overcast days are great, get plenty of B-roll of the environment.


## Exteriors night


### With modern cameras we can see a lot


### Neat Video is Philip’s noise reduction software


### Pumping up the ISO allows us to work in darkness with a working depth of field


## ****Exercise:**** recreate lighting of favorite scene


# Movement


## Movement brings dynamism but unmotivated it’s disorienting


## Remember, moves have a beginning, middle and end


## Locked off: it’s all about composition and movement within the frame.


## Zoom: it’s the move that people cannot do. Used for reframing or effect. Be careful if your lens isn’t parfocal (pretty much every stills lens isn’t).


## Pan & whip pan: you need a good fluid head, panning on the head instead of the handle gives smoother results. Whip pan can be used to hide cuts.


## Autofocus: when something <span class="underline"><span class="underline">exits</span></span> frame you’ll have to hold some button so it keeps focus instead of making the background sharp


## Hand-held is easier manual focus. Autofocus is great if there’s faces or tracking things in shot.


## Slider shots can be used in interviews or wides and continuously keep going, for example.


## When tracking subjects, know what they’ll do because playing catch-up looks bad.


## Jibs can make nice cinematic shots, especially establishing. They’re slow, heavy, difficult to move. Use a gentle touch.


## Lenses in movement


### Long lens makes things move much faster sideways


### Front-back movement with a long lens seems slower


## Shot types


### Full shot / wide: subject fully in frame, subject in relation to environment


### Medium wide / medium long: subject cut off just below the knees


### Cowboy: from roughtly mid-tights up


### Medium: waist-up, one of most common shots used, room for extra person (Two Shot)


### Medium close up: chest & shoulders up


### Close up: still see full face


### Choker: into personal space, from mid-neck, head cut off


### Extreme close up: focusing on specific elements in face, “italian shot”


### Over the shoulder: used a lot in dialog


### Focus pull: move concentration by changing focus


### Dutch angle: horror


### High angle: viewer can feel empowered


### Low angle: weakens viewer’s point of view, subjects more powerful


## ****Challenge:**** Practice movement, and movement in frame


# Sequences


## In film, everything we see on screen is a sequence.


## To find shots, look with your eyes, not with a camera


## If you don’t know the sequence, ask the person you’re filming what they’re doing


## ****Get coverage.**** Get a whole run of a single standpoint if possible, and repeat for other standpoints.


## Start a run wide, usually.


## We might want is one more time for sound, with just the microphone really close.


## A character most of the time doesn’t <span class="underline"><span class="underline">have</span></span> to exit the frame. But good to have both the enter and exit frame on tape.


## In-Camera Editing


### Philip’s learning: not being patient enough when recording


### Practice: every shot is exactly in the order and length as in camera


## The establishing shot says: I recognize one landmark, so the next shot is in that location


## Breaking the 180 degree rule


### Crossing the axis


### Have the actor look away, follow his eyes


### Cut via a cutaway


## ****Challenge:**** film a sequence in camera


# Story and narrative


## Beach house


### Was really bad weather, lovely house, bad lighting


### Concept: 60s video, model is coming (you need a soul)


### Philip writes some notes/ideas in the evening and then switches off


### Philip’s lens: SLR Magic MicroPrimes


### Handle and cage make a more stable rig


### You have to set stabilization lens mm if the lens doesn’t have any electronics


### Spec video is work that you do without being paid, great way to start off.


### Light through windows usually has a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">pattern</span></span>


### You always need a back-up plan. Having to come back in better weather if needed is usually built-in to the budget with the client.


### Put pieces of grease paper underneath candles to fill the spill


### “The best thing about drinking wine on camera is continuity… So pretty much Veronica needs a full glass all the time.”


### Philip needed a character to be able to make the connection with the beach: only this way they could’ve moved to outside


## The Restaurant


### Goal: for people who have researched the restaurant, so they’re convinced to come book


### Shots: kitchen preparation, beauty shots of food, interview with the owner, shots of a full restaurant with a lot of happy customers


### “Most likely, it’s the food shots that’s going to make the customers come.”


### Interview checkboxes: where she’s from (special for her), why the restaurant, what’s so good about the restaurant, things about the food. Just tidbits to cut in between. Cinematic Masterclass has an interview episode. Tips: try to get part of the question in the answer. Warm-up questions.


### To this on spec for a restaurant (or another place) to get in on your portfolio


### “I do recommend editing stuff relatively quickly.”


## ****Challenge:**** Go to a local business and make a short video for them, for free.


# Post Production


## Media management


### This is incredibly important


### Thinktank memory card pouches


### Used = put face down. When using multiple cameras (on big shoots), useful to label used cards


### Gnarbox is useful for same-day backups


### Have enough cards to last you an entire day, hopefully a few days. You want to deal with your media after.


### ****Always keep two copies minimum**** when editing. Make sure you have a proper copy.


### If you can, use checksumming software that makes sure you copied everything.


### ****99% of mistakes are human.****


### When editing, make sure your sources are on a fast hard drive.


### Label clips in-camera if things get confusing.


### Convert video to ProRes because H.265 is horrible to edit with


### Tip: set Premiere Pro Auto-Save to another drive or even the cloud


### “After you’ve checked, leave it going to two additional hard drives overnight.”


## The computer


### Calibrate when you have multiple screens.


### Everything in the room needs to be as nice as possible, so you can spend weeks in the editing room.


## Structure, La Taberna


### Find the nicest stuff


### Don’t touch your nicest stuff. You can play with it a bit, but what’s important is that you ****start by creating a structure****.


### If the person is not in frame, you can cut out all the “uuhm”s


### Tip: ****colorize clips by camera / type of shot****


### Normally, withing 3-4 seconds of hearing someone you need to see their face. Here she’s in shot for about 3 seconds, which is just long enough. “It’s very deliberate when she’s in vision: at the end of a sentence of when she’s smiling.”


### Editing is <span class="underline"><span class="underline">so much</span></span> about rhythm


### We often put her back in frame when there’s a transition. In the end we only see her for about 12 seconds of the 2 minutes but it <span class="underline"><span class="underline">feels natural</span></span>.


### ****Keep ambient sounds to make it feel closer by.****


### “I do my levels to peak at -6dB, but my actual export peaks at -3dB. There’s no standard on the internet, you’ll hear all sorts of things, but as long as it doesn’t go over 0 you’ll be fine.”


### ****Ducking.**** You want it to be imperceptible. The key level frame should be halfway through when starting to talk.


### ****Always use a crossfade on audio clips.****


## “The ability to reframe when you shoot in 4K and only have to deliver in HD is sooo great.”


## ****In-edit cropping of 4K to HD is great especially in interviews.****


## Sound FX, Music, Beach House


### Beach house was much harder to shoot but a lot easier to edit, because it wasn’t shot in documentary-style (rather shot to edit).


### “I’ve been using Musicbed for 8 or 9 years.”


### ****Search for music even before filming**** if your video is music-driven, to get a feel for the edit


### Philip has about 170 tracks listed for this project!


### Musicbed has specific <span class="underline"><span class="underline">artists</span></span> so you can have favorites there.


### If you shorten your search to the actual length you want you’re limiting yourself a lot, better to cut it.


### ****Music makes or breaks the video.**** It takes a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">long</span></span> time to find the right track.


### ****Remix Editing in Audition****

1.  Open track in multitrack

2.  Select song > Properties > Enable Remix

3.  Se target duration

4.  Boom

5.  Play around with parameters, or add in some manual edits


### “I didn’t want to show the house immediately, so it would be a reveal.”


### “I letterboxed the interstitial drone shots to make them a theme, so it’s more cinematic.”


### (Definitely for TV), consider safe margins


### Normally ****put the edit a frame before the beat****, but listen to it


## Color


### “One of the best platforms is DaVinci Resolve, and the free version is very powerful. It’s also a great piece of editing software. There’s a great course on MZed.”


### \_<sub>FilmConvert</sub>\_\_ is a film emulation tool with a ton of LUTs built-in. If you want to use it, make sure your camera is set to a picture profile that’s supported by the software.


### Get an X-Rite and get it as right as possible. 8-bit is not really forgiving.


### Skintones need to be 70-75 IRE (brightness), for bright skin at least.


### Go through each clip and color correct. The main goal is to make the clips look consistent.


### “FilmConvert speeds up my workflow <span class="underline"><span class="underline">so much</span></span> but I recommend you still learn to color grade manually in DaVinci Resolve. It’s the best color grading tool and you’ll understand everything much better.”
