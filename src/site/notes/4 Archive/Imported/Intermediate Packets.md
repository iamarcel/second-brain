Your goal is to **find and curate the best, most special Lego blocks** and then only at then end put them together. (In your notes, these are [[0 Inbox/Evergreen Note|Evergreen Notes]]).

If we consider the focused application of our **attention to be our greatest asset** as knowledge workers, we can no longer afford to let that **intermediate work** disappear.

Thinking *small* is the best way to elevate your horizons and expand your ambitions.

Advantages:
- You become **interruption proof** because you can load an IP in your mind instead of the entire project
- You’ll be able to **make progress in any span of time**
- The quality of your work increases because you ask for feedback earlier and more often
- You’ll have to many IPs at your disposal that you can execute entire projects from assembling IPs

Types of intermediate packets:
- Distilled notes
- Outtakes
- Work-in-process
- Final deliverables
- Documents created by others

You can sit down to purposefully create an IP but it is far more **powerful to *notice* the IPs you have already produced** and then take an extra moment to save them to your Second Brain.
