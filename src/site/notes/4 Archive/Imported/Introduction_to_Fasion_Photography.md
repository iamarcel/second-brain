# Introduction


## Fashion photography is usually in a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">series</span></span> to advertise something


## Go to a library and get as many libraries as you want


## Libraries might even have things available online


## Magazine spreads create ****contrast, variation and continuity****


# Contrast & Variation


## Contrast captures attention


## Black & White vs. Color


### Putting these in the same image captures attention


## Contrast in poses, which part is photographed


## Show full body, waist up and face only.


## Front, side, 3/4 posing.


## When looking, ask: what’s the same, what’s different, what’s tying them together?


## Camera-aware vs. non-aware. (So where subjects are both looking <span class="underline"><span class="underline">at</span></span> and another where the subjects are looking <span class="underline"><span class="underline">away from</span></span> the camera.)


### Looking away = creating a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">story</span></span>, and some mystery.


### Looking to = portraiture.


## Big color blocks


### Simplifies design but attracts attention
