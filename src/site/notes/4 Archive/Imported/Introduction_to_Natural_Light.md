# Tools


## Camera \* larger sensor is better, you can blur the background


## Lens \* Scorr prefers prime lenses, even kit lens works for a lot of wide-angle shots


## 24mm f/1.4 is a great wide angle lens


## Go-to lens: 55m f/1.8


## Fast lenses are a must (f/1.4 \* f/2.8)


## Reflector


## Diffuser (included in 5-in-1 reflector)


# Natural light advantages


## Fastest workflow


## Best light \* often huge light sources that make beautiful photos if you find the right pockets


## Cost effective


## Easy to create a signature style \* with a simpler workflow it’s easier to create your specific style


## Artificial light should mimic natural light \* so you need to understand it


# Finding good light: ****catchlights****


## ****Catchlights are huge to know when you’re in good light.****


## Created when the subjects ****is in a darker area**** and ****looking towards a brighter area****


## Outdoors, created by either a ****reflection**** caused by the sun the ****sky****


## For example, a ****window**** is a great place to make a picture because it makes a catchlight


## Example: subject under shadow, sunlight from behind, looking at the sky which makes the catchlight


## ****Subject in shade, looking towards bright sky****


## Be obsessed with catchlights


# Windows for catchlights


## Principle: light contrast


## Technique: subject in shadow, looking at brightness


## Window


## Open door


## Shade should make you happy, that’s where you’ll put your subject


## Use largest light sources possible.


## Turn bright things (e.g., bride’s dress) away from the light.


# Doors for catchlights


## Sliding doors canbe opened further


## In wedding it’s often a mess, so ****shoot up for a clean backgtound****


## You can use more than one light source


# Using shade to your advantage


## Where to find shade


### Trees


### Between walls or buildings


### Overhangs


### Archways or large openings


### Low sun \* the lower the sun, the more shadow it creates


## In overcast weather there’s quite a bit of light from straight above which can make raccoon eyes, so make the subject look up towards the light.


## You can find awesome catchlights in between walls


## Shoot into the depth of a street, or turn 90 degrees and use the long sides of the street as sidelights


## Sometimes the sun will light a wall on one side and put the other in the shade. So you can use the wall as reflector.


## High sun both creates shade and lights up the ground


## Overhangs make light more directional


## Underneath a peer is beautiful light


## Tunnels create great light from two sides. Move to one end so one side has stronger light than the other.


# Shooting in harsh light


## Problems: raccoon eyes, no catchlights, sharp shadows, subjects will squint, backgrounds are often overexposed


## ****Use bright colors.**** Direct sunlight looks amazing with bright colors.


## Soften the light with a reflector or diffuser.


## ****Look for speckled shadows.****


## ****Use the sun as <span class="underline"><span class="underline">side</span></span> light.****


## ****Shoot into the darkness.****


## ****Take a silhouette.****


## Focus on ****color**** in bright light, both in subject and in sunlight.


# Harsh light with diffuser or reflector


## ****A white shoot-through umbrella can work as a reflector****


## Let subject rotate reflector into right position


## Lean subject against wall to let the wall be the reflector


## Diffuser reduces hotspots and


# Using shadows to your advantage


## Shadows create mystery, especially in special shapes


## Place eyes in hot spot (shadowless part), expose for lighest part of image


## Shadows are a good way to mix up the types of photos


# The sun as sidelight


## Look for repetitive highlights and shadows


## Combine with other natural light techniques


# Shooting into darkness


## Find a hotspot (where sun peeks through)


## Make sure what’s <span class="underline"><span class="underline">behind</span></span> the subject is a lot darker


## Put subject in bright spot, expose for brightest part


## Subjects will pop off the frame


# Creating a silhouette


## Your subject has to be an interesting shape


## A face profile gives an interesting shape


# Finding rim light


## Find a bright spot on the floor, place subject’s face in that light


## Determine the amount of glow with your exposure


## Fill in shadows to subject’s face if it’s dark


# Reflections


## Place subject in good light


## Find reflective surface, darker is better
