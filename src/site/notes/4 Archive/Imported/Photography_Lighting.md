# Create soft light


## A small shoot-through umbrella can definitely be enough, just put it close enough.


# Create shadows by having light off the camera, this shapes subjects and creates drama


# Use a ****rim light form the back**** to separate a subject. Use a flash instead of video light here, it should be strong enough.


# Fairy lights can give a cool effect. Wrap them around a transparent plate to easily hold them in front of the lens.


# Use \*\*continuous lights in low light\*\*—they’re flexible to shoot with but not strong enough in daylight.


# ****Shadows create mystery.****


# ****Shadows shape subjects.****


# Setups


## ****Fairy light leading line.**** Subject and photographer hold ends of fairy light strip.


## ****Film noir: iPhone light through fork.**** Hold the fork close to the phone for soft light, make sure the eyes are lit up.


## ****Shapely shadows on background.**** Flash or light through something with holes (e.g., light stand arms) to make some shadows on the background.
