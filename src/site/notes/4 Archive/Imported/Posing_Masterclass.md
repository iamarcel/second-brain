# Keys to posing


## Maximize beauty


## Start with a realistic and organic ****emotion****.


### It’s about the emotion wrapped in a pose.


## Posing is both technical and emotional


## Must get subjects to buy into a story or emotion


## Failure to pose correctly produces <span class="underline"><span class="underline">inconsistency</span></span>


## Create a positive environment


## Work quickly and efficiently


# Three Essential Poses (Female)


## Classic Elegance


### The most widely used pose in the world


### Nose toward light


### Body away (especially if they’re wearing a color brighter than complexion)


### This pose creates short side shadow


### Use a sweeping motion for the model, where you end up is where the pose should be. Sweep towards the leading leg.


### Shift weight on leading leg (leg far away?) and that leg has to be <span class="underline"><span class="underline">straight</span></span>. Pop the hip out towards the leading leg.


### Trailing leg is slightly bent. Knees together (holding an orange between the knees)


### Have them give a little more and exaggerate the pose. They might feel a little awkward.


### Have space in the waist so you can see how narrow it is.


### Have the hands at different heights.


### If the hands look like they’re doing something, it looks natural.


### Always try to have the side or inside of the hand, not the outside.


### If they lean towards the camera a little bit, it creates better angles.


### You can turn the head to the light and move the eyes towards the camera. It’s not easy to do.


## Modern Pose


### Nose towards light


### Shoulders at an angle


### Pop hip


### Raise knee: makes more of an hourglass shape


### Especially if models have it difficult with poses, just let them lean against something.


### Raising the knee inwards gives the model a more hourglass-like shape.


### Shoulders not square to the camera, slightly off.


### Having the knee visible is what makes that shape. So either let it come through the slit, or ask the model to lift up their skirt to just above the knee.


### Important is the ****weight shift****, ****head in the same direction**** as the weight shift, and then the leg lift


### In general, the head is where the weight is


### The difference with the elegant pose: the lifting of the knee, instead of trailing the sway.


## The Roll Over Pose


### Pose when someone’s on the ground or sitting.


### Roll up on hip (just like shifting the weight)


### Cross one leg (knee) over the other


### Nose to the light


### Move arm out of the way so you can see the shape of the hip


### When lying on the side, bring top knee before the other, that accentuates the hip more.


# Posing Hands & Arms


## Rather something simple 100% correct than something creative 80% correct.


## The Cigarette


### As if a person is holding a cigarette


### Palm down or up


### You want to have the ****wrist bent****


### Example: take the hand, shake it out, let it fall, lift it up a little bit (and let the fingers naturally lay there)


### Always ****shoot the edge**** of the hand. That minimizes its size and frames the face.


### You can rest the cigarette hand on the other wrist.


## The Shoulder Tap


### Slightly touch with the hand, palm up


### Usually you’ll rotate the head


### Works great with directional light so you can get some short side shadow


### Look into the light, ****tap shoulder towards the light****


### Pose gets better with mode directional light and more face in profile


## The Necklace / Collar Bone


### give the hands something to do to make them more casual


### Let them glide over the collarbone slightly


### Touch with the hand away of the light, so it doesn’t create a hotspot that distracts from the face


## The Hair Pull


### Keep elbow in and hair pull out


## The Dress Pull


### Useful at weddings or very long dresses


### Hold long dress up


### Bend the arm


### Gives subject more weight especially for epic wide-angle shots


## The Yin-Yang


### Creating balance and triangles


### One hand on or above the head


### The other hand below creating another triangle


### Ying-Yang-BOOM is a third triangle by lifting the knww


### Create balance in poses with the arms


### You have to be the model’s mirror, you have full responsibility of their pose


### Nice to do when the model can lean against something


## Face Framing


### Naturally, lightly touch face so the shape of the head stays intact


### Have one hand higher than the other


### Shoot the side of the hands, not the front


# Headshots


## Tips


### Shoot down on your subject (just a little bit)


### Use soft directional light


### Use 50mm lens or greater


### Create subtle shadows to contour the face (that’s why large light source)


### Catchlights are a must! Subjects need to be in a darker area than how they’re lighted.


### Be aware of a person’s ****face plane****. In general, have the camera sensor in the same plane as that of the model’s face.


### Find the sweet spot. Sometimes moving the head a millimeter can put it in or out of the sweet spot.


## Technical Aspects


### ****Define the Line****. Turn the head to get the corner of the eye close to the line of the edge of the face, and hide the ear. (Visually) Don’t cur off the eye. Do not let the nose break the face line. Short side shadow.

### ****Break the Spine.**** Never have the spine perpendicular to the ground—or it’ll look stiff. Have shoulders tilted a bit so it creates a triangle for the head to rest on.


### ****Nose Towards the Light.****


### Try to keep things clean, it’s less cleanup.


### You can use a backlight to define the cheek: a defining shadow remains on the cheek.


## On location posing females


### Not used to posing? Use a chair for example: easier to shift weight. Also when standing up, that’s what they can hold on to.


### Start pose from the ground up. Move feet and bottom part 45 degrees.


### Put all the weight on the hip furthest away from the camera.


### Lift inside leg a little bit to create the hourglass V look.


### Have the body one way and the head another way, that’s easiest.


### Find some space inside the waist by having the hand on the hip. If she looks a bit like a chicken wing, move that hand back.


### Pose the subject and say “give me a little bit more.”


### When rotating the feet away fro the camera, you can move the shoulders back a bit so those shoulders create a triangle for the face.


### Elongate the neck by making the subject move down their shoulders and lean forward a bit.


## On location posing with a chair


### Sit at the edge of the chair


### Roll over the hip, move far hip over/above other leg


### This is a great pose for someone not experienced


### Keep the angle of the face at the same  angle as the camera, that’s why you would for example bend down or ask them to move their chin up or down


### Make sure hands are completely relaxed, if hands are tense you’ll see that.


### Very easy to do: lean over the back of a chair. Pay attention to the hands, they should not be sticking forwards or they’ll end up too big.


# Male Headshots


## Liberties


### You can shoot a man square on, gives confidence.


### Profile / sidelight gives a lot more drama


## Theory


### Relaxed and Confident


### Hard light or soft light


### Start with sitting or leaning


### Shadows = strength


### Split lighting


## Sitting poses


### One shoulder (far away) lowered


### Head tilt towards lower shoulder, conveys strength. Feminine = head towards higher shoulder.


### Legs at a slight angle


### Square shoulders are good for a thinframe


### Lean forward


### Nice position: straddle the chair and lean forward, works basically every single time. Chair also hides belly fat.


### Search for architectural things in the environment that look masculine


### You don’t want the hands too far apart


### Sometimes you want the arms forming a circle to close, so they frame the face


## Leaning


### Leaning back slightly breaks the spine


### Crossing legs forces someone to lean on one leg


### You can lean sideways against a wall and pop the hip out away from the wall


## Standing


### Position feet first


### Feet 45 deg to camera


### Also here, lean on back leg & leave space inside waist


### Pop the hip away from the camera, rotate hip towards the camera


### Head tilt towards lower shoulder


### Or, use sidelight


### Stairs are great to put all the weight on the lower stair


### Sometimes, get someone out of a pose and put them in again, they’ve been in there so long it starts to look unnatural


# Posing Couples


## Can be hard


## Overarching keys


### If you can’t pose <span class="underline"><span class="underline">one</span></span>, you can’t pose two


### When in doubt, pose one and then another


### When in doubt, light high and middle


### Capture a variety of emotions. You want variety in your set.


### Most couples want a “photojournalistic story of love” so ****don’t let them look into the camera****


## Couple posing system


### Every pose goes through a routine of expressions and micro-adjustments


### Look at each other


### One looks at the other, other looks away. Bride towards the light, groom towards the bride.


### Close their eyes, get close & smile. That;s a sort of “kiss” that doesn’t distort the face’s shape.


### Both look towards the light, a la “both looking towards our future”


### Smile, can be used any time


### Hysteric laugh


### Touch each other but look away of each other


## Posing on location


### Trick for better walking: sometimes people look stiff when walking. So make them ****run****, they look better, start laughing and it’s great.


### Surprise them by giving sudden instructions, so they don’t have an image in their head and can’t think too much


### You don’t want a sea of hands so it looks like an octopus, so cover up one’s arm/hand with the other.


# Transitional poses with couples


## Theory


### Start with one pose and transition into others


### Hold hands

1.  There should actually be a space, a V between the hands

2.  Variety: lead the bride down the stairs, kiss the hand

3.  Create a hinge so they don’t stand square to the camera. Weight on back leg.


### Hip to hip

1.  Hips together, but female leans back a abit (that creates a V)

2.  She can use his shoulder to lean back, that has a kind of classic look to it


### The dip

1.  As she’s leaning back, he can hold her leg and she can dip a bit more. He may need to reposition his leg.

2.  “James Bond” with high slit split dress. She’s wrapped around him where he’s square to the camera.


### Bride’s back

1.  Bride rotates further from the James Bond and shows her back.

2.  Put the light to the bride’s nose.

3.  Often brides love to show the back.

4.  Remember, you can shoot at different angles. Or let your second photographer do that.


### The protector

1.  Show the groom’s back, she’s behind him, holding him and looking over his shoulder.

2.  Tip: groom’s nose by the temple of the bride, or at the cheeck.


### The walk away

1.  Hold hands again but walk away this time

2.  Make a V, look inside


### Then shoot wide first, close after. Do all the micro-posing <span class="underline"><span class="underline">within</span></span> that sequence.

### Learning to pose a couple can make you a lot of money.


## On Location


### Let her give her chin to him a bit, it’s more romantic


### Always be conscious so you can see both their faces


### Once you get into a good pose, maximize it with micro-adjustmejts


# Getting the most out of your poses


## Positive energy ****killers****


### Getting a great shoot is much more about good vibes and capturing the essence


### ****Hesitation****


### ****Idleness**** (always keep busy, and explain what you’re doing)


### ****No dialogue with subject****


### ****Giving stern directions**** (don’t forget how you’re talking with subjects)


### ****Not copmlimenting**** (you can only go up if you give compliments, do it even if they’re not that good)


### ****Not being appreciative****


### ****Coming in with no energy**** (your photography mirrors you)


## Positive energy ****creators****


### Everything opposite to the killers, of course


### ****Be prepared****. Do not waste time, have a plan B, C and D.


### ****Constant affirmation****. Even beautiful people need it. The more you affirm them, the better the shoot will be.


### ****Be present and likeable.**** Photography is a social skill.


### ****Communicate what you’re doing.****


### ****Share your vision.**** It’s really important for them to know so they can help you get your shot.


### ****Be excited.**** To be honest, you’re an entertainer too.


### ****Be funny/entertaining**** in your own way.


### ****Show them your good images.**** It builds their confidence. If you’re excited they will too.


### ****Thank them.****


## Get the most out of your clients


### ****Be a leader.**** You can’t be behind the scenes, or let them tell <span class="underline"><span class="underline">you</span></span> what to do. When they don’t know what to do they won’t be confident in you.


### ****Be likeable.**** Read <span class="underline"><span class="underline">How to win friends and influence people</span></span>.


### ****Be confident.**** If you can’t be, your subjects can’t either. Get more practice.


### ****Pose by showing.**** Be a mirror, even for females. If you go there, they’ll go there. Secret sauce: <span class="underline"><span class="underline">show the emotion</span></span> too.


### ****Never say left or right.**** Take their head on a string in your hand. Gesture, show in mirror, show visually and with audio at the same time.


### ****Learn to work fast.**** Subjects hate to wait.


### ****Respect & professionalism.****


## Final 8 tips for Mastery


### ****Nose to the light.**** Posing and lighting go together, so this is easy to forget.


### ****Body away from the light.**** Especially if their clothes are lighter than their complexion. Robots have the face and body in the same direction.


### ****Shift weight.**** One leg must be straight.


### ****Helper.**** Have them lean on something to do the pose if it’s hard.


### ****Break the spine.****


### ****Yin-yang.**** Create balance in your photos.


### ****Add <span class="underline"><span class="underline">emotion</span></span>.**** This makes <span class="underline"><span class="underline">the look</span></span>.


### ****Master the poses.**** Learn them in the mirror too.
