# Four Secrets


# Posing Hack


## People who make sculptures: when you can make a <span class="underline"><span class="underline">rock</span></span> look lifelike, you’ve got some skill.


## Posing Principles


### Shift weight on one leg


### Nose towards the light


### Body in a different direction


## Exercise: stand in front of a mirror, set up lighting, make minor adjustments and practice looking at the light. See how a master poses someone.


# Composition Trick


## Background behind the subject needs to be simple.


## Just look for shapes in the frame. Find a large, clean shape to put your subject’s head in.


# Magic Light


## Expose for the background and <span class="underline"><span class="underline">only then</span></span> bring in the subject (because you can’t control the background)


## Fill in your subject with a flash, 80cm see-through umbrella at 1 meter distance.


# The Only Edit


## Remember you are telling a story with your photo, and use that to make your subject <span class="underline"><span class="underline">pop off</span></span>. Main subject should be brightest and sharpest, make all the rest darker and less sharp.


## We want our viewer to look at the photo in a specific order.


## Do the squint test.


# You have to master all four of those.
