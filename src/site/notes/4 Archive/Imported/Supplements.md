# Base
## Vitamin D
Officially deficient in a large part of the population. Higher than “normal” doses are probably optimal. Is technically a hormone, works actively in a huge amount of system processes.

Cheapest way to get this is in droppers.

Dose: 5000IU daily or something around that.

## Magnesium + [[4 Archive/Notes/Zinc\|Zinc]]
Magnesium deficiency is common in the western diet.

Magnesium helps sleep, and is synergetic with sleep. For people deficient in either (even a bit), supplementing had a big impact on [Testosterone](Testosterone.md) levels.

There are a lot of different variants that might have a focus of impact on other parts off the body.

Dose:
-   450mg magnesium
-   30mg zinc


## Fish Oil
Green Pasture *fermented* cod liver oil + butter. Ferented cod liver oil seems to have better effects than regular cod liver oil, as it’s more bioavailable[?].

## Creatine
Most well-researched workout supplement. Helps ATP production.

# [Testosterone](Testosterone.md)
