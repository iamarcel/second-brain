# Act like a pro
Set a schedule that you follow no matter what. Even recording and editing at midnight.

It will give you creative discipline. It will motivate you to get your other habits straightened out.

Imaging if the girl you love would have het brains blown out if you got to 100k.

Do it with the intention and winner's mindset. This **is** possible.

# Niche by emotion, not subject
Viewer doesn't really have much affiliation with the subject of your video. What they care about is *who you are* and **the emotion they are getting from watching your video**. E.g., red pill is guys making you go to the gym.

# Always break down your video into points
Break down + give a preamble of the points in the video. Gives trust that you planned and have some things coming up.

# Build a premise at the start of the video
How did we get here? What is the larger meaning of why we are doing it? The more emotional and impactful, the more minutes of watch time you are earning.

Premise justifies you sitting down through the video.

Every YouTube video is a mini movie. 

You can also do it with a comedy sketch, or a montage with establishing shots.

# The algorithm is just human beings
Study people who do good video. Think why your videos are not doing well if they aren't. What do I like about his video or my video, and why?

Stop Matt D'Avella every 10 seconds and write down what is happening and why.

The more you make videos the more you act like a pro. You are part of the algorithm.

The videos I have loved, with time they get the attention they deserve.

Get to a point where you like your videos more.

VidIQ coaching and a lot of video influencers, they're trash.

Watch your own video. When are you bored?

# Hire a thumbnail guy
You're probably not talented enough. The sad truth with titles and thumbnails: if you're a pro YouTuber, you're like a pro movie poster creator.

It makes a huge difference to have a pro level. 10k ROI. You want your thumbnail to be the most creative, inspiring, story telling driven representation of your title.

Do I think my thumbnails are fucking incredible?

# Don't perform, speak with authenticity
Human being have this amazing capacity to sense if someone is speaking authentically or not. If we can sense that, you just get views because of that. Talk like you tlak to a friend or a younger brother. Don't talk to a class of students.

# Video quality doesn't matter. Audio does.
People don't really care about good B-roll anymore. For the most part it's about the interesting, valuable words.

Write well.
Script well.
Rehearse the script.

# Use different Content Phrases to retain attention
The reason Matt gets views is because he explains the same thing in different ways.

Different Content Phrases:
- A-roll
- Voiceover
- Vlog style (that determines immediacy)
- Interview
- Comedy sketch

Switching up the vibes helps. Change it as soon as the viewer got used to it. Music or different Content phrase.

# 99.9% of people don't work hard enough
If you work hard and intelligently enough you can make it.

This is the core of it all.

**How hard do you actually work?**

Most people just try one thing to a minute degree, and stop if there's no immediate success.

**The details don't matter as much as the striving.** How badly do you want it?
