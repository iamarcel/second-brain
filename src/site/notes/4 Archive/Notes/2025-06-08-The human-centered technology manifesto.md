# THE PURPOSE

The end goal of technology is human flourishing. From this principle, all the others flow naturally.

## Technology is contained

The tools, the gadgets, the innovations—they're just a means to an end. At some point, they have to step away.

Let the robots be more robotic so the humans can be more human.

## Technology is opinionated

Everything we build reflects the opinion and ideals of its maker. Don't avoid that—instead, scrutinize your opinion so the technology reflects good ideas.

## Technology embraces intuition

Humans expect things to move when they push them, are exceptional at remembering physical spaces, and have an inherent desire for social contact. With this knowledge, we can build things that go hand-in-hand with our instincts.

## Technology thinks long-term

People are easily swayed towards short-term gratification at the expense of our happiness.

Bad technology exploits this for its own benefit. Good technology nudges us to do what's best for us years and decades down the line.

## Technology is beautiful

In a beautiful environment we can live in peace. Our sense of beauty is one of the most powerful ways to access the wisdom and processing of our subconscious.

"Vibe checking" is not optional.

## Technology quietly supports

Humans feel alive most around people they care for or making things that matter. Not being dopamine-bombarded by consumption.

Technology shouldn't capture our attention, shouldn't be in our face and shouldn't try to do things better than us.

Technology should guard us like a bonfire—quietly crackling in the background, keeping us warm in the background while we connect and grow.

Because after all, humans are beautiful and our flourishing is what it's all about.
