# Quotes

The Noble man chooses to endure hardship not because he hates himself but because he loves himself, and wants to become stronger and realize his full potential even when it is unnecessary or even unwanted.

I am a man and that is good. Because I love myself and my life and my faith, and I want to be more of what I am—for my own sake.

Why not live life as if you were chosen by the gods?

I help others not because of pity, but because of a superabundance of power.

When you feel the need to argue that the things you are good at are the best and most important things to be good at; this is ressentiment-motivated transvaluation.

Becoming a more complete beast is:

-   Being challenged by other men in your peer group often, and meeting those challenges
-   Continuously taking small risks
-   Mastering skills
-   Making difficult decisions
-   Doing something he doesn’t like for his peer group, to increase a sense of belonging
-   Training strength, courage, mastery and honor
-   Working towards the realization of these aptitudes through disciplined practice, seeking an environment that tests and fosters these talents

He does this of his own volution, choosing masculinity for himself because he wants to (not as a reaction to an external influence), guided by his sense of internal worthiness and confidence in his ability to determine what is bad, good, better and best.

Unsatisfied with just inhabiting a male body, he chooses the way of Men, that rigorous path towards the impossibly far North of male, to invoke and manifest within himself a higher form and a more advanced, more perfect expression of his masculine potential. Masculinity is not a necessity, but this man chooses the path of rigor as a philosophical virtue.

“\*Great men are not motivated by what is necessary, satisfactory or practical. Great men are motivated by what is…great.\* That which is necessary merely facilitates beauty and greatness.”

“You have given value to strength, not because it is necessary or demanded of you, but because **you believe that strength has value in and of itself**. You have given value to strength because **you love your life and love yourself and you believe that making yourself stronger also makes you more completely what you are**.”

“This Noble Beast is, first of all, a man.
He loves himself, says YES to his own life, celebrates his own existence, and seeks to discharge his own strength. He is a man who wants to become more of what he is, more of what a man is. He wants to be stronger, more courageous, more skillful.
To become stronger, more courageous and more skillful he realizes that he must surround himself with and be tested by other men who demonstrate these core masculine virtues. He strives to earn the respect of his chosen tribe in word and deed, to honor them and be honored by them.”

**Golden Laughter** is the incapability to take seriously for any length of time enemies, disasters, misdeeds. This is the sign of full force that heals quickly and produces forgetfulness. Laugh at misfortune. Forget those who wronged you. I've spent a lot of time hating people whose names I no longer remember.

The noble man doesn't have hatred, he has **contempt**. He doesn't obsess about the people that truly suck—he ignores and pities them.

Respect your enemies but don't have enemies you don't respect.

The anti-noble builds towards utility, while the noble builds for greatness. The castle vs. Soviet architecture.

The way of masters is *choosing*.
