# Simple
## Compact
Tap into the messages that have already stuck.

Needing a lot of data / explanation is not good.
Linux vs Windows, Ballmer: Linux is free like a puppy is free.

## Unexpected
The best way to get attention is to break the pattern.

- Crystallize: highlight what the audience (thinks it) knows
- Break: completely break it up

You need to *create or exploit a knowledge gap*.
- Point to missing knowledge
- Present a puzzle
- Assert that someone else knows something they don't
- Get listeners to predict an outcome

## Emotional
1. Appeal to the emotional  side
2. On the backend, how can they justify to themselves?

Be intentional about this. Don't bury your audience with data and rational points, hoping they stick.

**Great content isn't written, it's assembled.**

## Story
Vivid details cause a 30% shift in better convincing. Bring them in to bring stories alive.
