# Lessons

- I didn't learn anything new at this event, but Vishen sold $4M of his program: 500 people paid $8K to join a weekly 2-hour call. The outline was clearly ChatGPT-generated and it was clear to me that their plan wasn't very fleshed-out at all.
	- Pricing turned quite some people off, yet they filled up the seats and have a waiting list now.
- A lot of people never thought about tooling in their business. They got overwhelmed and impressed by relatively basic things.
- AI attracts people but often they need non-AI things *first*. Though having AI now can accelerate whatever they're doing.
- Abstract talk doesn't work. People need *specific* things. Vishen's main selling point was saving 1-2 days per week of work. They overwhelmed people with ideas here and then sold them to the more detailed course.
- This overwhelmed people, they need hand-holding. I don't have to be afraid of filling those 2 hours per week, most people are a lot slower than I am.
- Let's pick up the people who didn't buy AI Mastery. I'll make a better program that's cheaper: [[4 Archive/Notes/AI Accelerator Program\|AI Accelerator Program]]

We're not here to think about safety risks or taking over the world, were here to get the most out of it as knowledge workers, entrepreneurs, coaches.

AI is like money. Not good nor evjl. Can be used in a good way of bad way depending on your consciousness.

Vishen puts a lot of emphasis on dabbling vs expert. If you can be the top 1% your competitive edge will be incredible. This is what companies are willing to pay half a million dollar for.

You can buy a drone and bomb for less than $1000. The only thing preventing people from doing that is consciousness.

I found myself saving 1.5 days per week.

Deploying Vykintas on any team improved their efficiency. Using no code tools.

Be polite so if it decides to kill is all, it will keep you for last.

Vishen is a history buff.

He did this on a full stage: takes some idea of a prompt and reads out the conversation.

As a knowledge worker you lose 20% of your time looking for information.

We made everyone put everything in Airtable.

## Use AI to write books in your voice
Prompt, paste in text, analyze, create reusable prompt for writing style.

If you are joining Mindvalley right now, you have to be in the top 1% in prompt engineering.

MW. People are loving this. They think it's going too fast.

Question: how long does it take to learn the minimum to get a big advantage from AI? Vishen: 10 minutes.

Question: how do I hire people who know AI? Vishen: yes hire a Chief AI Evangelist.

# Vykintas
Can you develop applications? 3%
Excel zapier logic? 15-20%

Applications are about creating value, automated. It doesn't matter what environment. Anything, even if it's not code, you can develop applications.

Shifts you need:
1. Identity. Yes you can.
2. Databases. Or linking data.

Single source of truth. You should have only a single place. Whole system can crumble. 

Airtable is more useful than SaaS because there are too many unique worlflows. And many different SaaS'es disconnect things.

Strategic framework:
1. Standardize (will I or my team use this process over and over?). Beginner is documentation, advanced is with AirTable.
2. Document
3. Iterate and improve
4. Align & empower
5. Emhance

Boom

The opportunities are endless

Become an artist of technology.

When you get to age 60 you'll take more prescription drugs than blueberries.

Think, what would you die for? Then live for it. The crazier the idea, the bette

There are many advantages to knowing how to code. Critical thinking, logical reasoning etc.

You don't need to be a coder, just a little bit, when you can ask ChatGPT.

Manon David has a good talk. Got into gamification and education.

Domenic is a great speaker.

Yes, my kids and grandkids will be able to speak to me again.

Mindvalley will be building a resort.

What makes people buy and relate:
- unfairness
- fear
- Frustration
