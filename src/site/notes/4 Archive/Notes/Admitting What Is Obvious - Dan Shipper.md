Ignoring what is obvious incurs a huge cost.

It requires you to go about your day numbing yourself to the reality of who you are and what you want—which is a waste of time for you and everyone around you.

You’re never going to be great at something you *want* to want. It’s always going to be a half-in, half-out kind of thing—instead of the all-in endeavor that greatness requires.

Once I admitted what was obvious, I realized there are a lot of people who have done something like what I want to do.

Admitting the obvious is to take a scary leap. It is to make decisions that bring your life into alignment with what you truly want—rather than what you think you *should* want or what others want from you. It is to risk taking the low-status meandering path, instead of the high-status linear one.

I think this is the way to admit the obvious. Loose a single thread in the direction of what you want. When it catches—follow it, and strengthen it. Eventually, you’ll be ready to cross the gap with confidence and spin a web of your own.
