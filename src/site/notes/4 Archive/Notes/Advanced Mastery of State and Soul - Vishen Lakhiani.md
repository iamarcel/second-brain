Two parts:
- Presence, bliss, awareness
- The fire, making things

Today: advanced version of the six phase. Things that aren't even in the book.

You want to be at max for these 6 things.

Compassion
Feeling of being loved and loving others
Gratitude
This has highest correlation with your happiness
Peace
Forgiveness is the key in 40 years of Zen to get into deeper states 
Vision
Self-Determination
Feeling supported
Specifically from what cannot be seen

There are two distinct senses of being we need to have:
- Happy in the now
- Vision of the future

These two create four states of mind.

Of you can't cultivate happiness now, you can't be productive. Salespeople 55% more effective if positive, doctors 90% better diagnoses.

The biggest mistake entrepreneurs make is hard work culture.

German workers are significantly more productive than US workers. They have much more holidays, less stressful work schedule.

## Embracing the Present
We want to increase perceptual diversity.

Meditation, presence, plant medicine—all these are increasing perceptual diversity. We want to get further than our 5 senses.

## Compassion
Close your eyes and see the eyes of someone you deeply love. Feel this, see their eyes and face.

This increases heart resonance.

Doing this for bigger groups then makes you see things around you in a more compassionate way.

It rectifies our fundamental attribution error.

Experiment speaking positive or insulting plants. Plants grow based on how we talk to them. Imagine what that means for your self-talk.

## Gratitude
Three levels: personal, work, self.

Satori is growth through insight.
Kensho's growth through pain.

The more you practice going within, the more Satori you will experience and the less Kensho.

## Forgiveness
Forgiving lead to the biggest spikes in brainwave alpha stata + left right coherence. This is the core practice in 40 years of Zen.

Story: in forgiving something seems to transcend time and space towards the other person you're forgiving.

Forgiving makes you unfuckwithable.

Steps:
1. Identify the person or act to forgive
2. Create the space you're comfortable in
3. Read the charges (imagine you're accusing in front of the judge)
4. Feel the anger and pain
5. Think of what you've learned in the event
6. Think about how the other person might have been hurt in the past
7. See it from their eyes
8. Forgive into love

Actually, most of the time you're forgiving a younger version of yourself.

## Future Vision
You need goals and celebrate getting there regularly to keep your bliss up.

**The more you enjoy what you're doing the more rocket fuel you have to do it better.**

### The quality of your dreams
Start dreaming bigger. This creates magic when you're in bliss.

**Ask not if are worthy of your dreams, ask if your dreams are worthy of you.**

Your dream should excite you a lot and scare you a little.

Vision creates focused thought and there seems to be magic in that. For example, create a vision board.

We set goals based on what we think we can do step by step. But we also need to aim for goals we can't reach yet.

### Future Dreaming
### The life line exercise
Imagine rising up and looking back at a timeline of your life.

Imagine 10 moments of pain, seeing them shrinking and becoming greyscale.

Imagine 10 moments of growth and joy, grow and brighten them.

Turn to the future and see 10 more moments in your future, make them brighter, bigger, bolder.
