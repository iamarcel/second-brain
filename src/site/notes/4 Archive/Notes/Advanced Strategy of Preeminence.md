I use story-driven educational, highly valuable content that is strategically designed to establish authority, and then to further the sale (establishing a chain of beliefs) down the line.

EDUCATION that is channeling desire towards me, as an advisor, and ultimately to the products and/or services I sell that solve real problems for the pocket of people I want to matter to.

We buy from people we like and trust, with whom we have rapport, and who appear to be an authority on the subject. People who honestly care.

*•   I'm not trying to sell you, I want to **serve** you.
•   Putting their needs before yours.
•   It's your job to help provide focus and clarity to them. Help connect the dots for them.
•   Ask yourself, “Who are we communicating with? What problems are we going to help them solve? How will we have the most impact on this person we are communicating with?

•   Remember: Your message doesn't have any value unless it makes an impact. Information alone is not motivating. Unless it makes a positive and profound impact.

•   People have to recognize your advice as a solution to a problem they feel emotionally as well as rationally about. Logic doesn't make a sale. You have to compel people on the emotional level.
•   “Show Me” is more powerful than “Tell me”. Allow a person to come to their own conclusion. You never want to draw the conclusion for them. You want them to draw the conclusion and then take action that makes a commitment.
•   Take the responsibility of being their most trusted adviser (their definitive trusted source).
•   You'll NEVER allow your clients/customers to:

•   purchase less than they should,
•   in less quantity or combination than they should,
•   in less quality than they should,
•   and less frequently than they should.
•   (because to allow them to do that, you breach your responsibility and moral obligation as their ‘trusted advisor').

•   **Establishing yourself from the very beginning as THE ONLY VIABLE SOLUTION, to a problem, a challenge, an issue, or an opportunity in their life.**
•   **The strategy of preeminence presumes the attitude that you look at everybody out there that you want to do business with, and that you make it a point of deciding you're NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR MONEY TO CHANGE HANDS BEFORE YOU START contributing, guiding, counseling, advising, and protecting them.***
