Subject: I'll keep teasing you until the end of time, {$name}

Body:

"Please, *please*, PLEASE!! Don't...*stop*."

That's the best part.

When everything is so good,
better with each passing second,
you see the floating puzzle pieces line up...

There's a spark of the bliss that's about to explode,
muscles start getting tense...

And then it just...
Stops?

**Commercial break!**

*Have you ever felt like real life is never as exciting as the movies? Try out new **multi-colored cereals** today!! Only $5.99 for the next week only. Guaranteed to get you both a sugar high and a sugar crash!! Don't delay, buy today.*

Now, one of the things I did just there is something I'll talk about in another letter.

But today‚Äîwell, that previous sentence was actually an example.

Aaaand that was another one üòâ

I guess now you want to know what I'm about to reveal.

You could call it **the universal rule of 2+2** and it's about storytelling.

If you haven't realized yet, all of marketing is about stories.

We humans *crave* it. We love it. Because they break through our minds and touch our hearts.

When you touch our heart, we *learn*.
When we feel your struggle, we *remember*.
When you show how you persisted and thrived, we *follow you*.

So if you want to really help transform someone, you've got to understand storytelling.

I've been working with on sales funnels recently and this "2+2" thing is really in the back of my mind all the time.

You see, you have answers for people.

**But they don't want to hear the answers.**

How many people know they should eat healthier or work out more‚Äîyet they don't?

*Just receiving the answer is boring.*

And if you bore your audience, they're not going to listen to what you have to say next.

No matter how good your lessons are, no matter how good your content is, no matter how life-changing your advice.

If you can't *pull them forward*, you've lost.

How do you do that?

**You hold back.** (Trust me, I know it's hard. But also fun.)

When the time is right, you have to stop.

(Just for a bit, of course‚Äî*always deliver in the end.* Trust comes first.)

And never give your audience "4."

Only give them a "2" and another "2."

Because when we listen to a story, it's *that gap* that makes us love it.



Go crush it. With love. üöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è

PS. I've got more details, tactics and tools for "yeah but how do you do this???" so keep reading my letters üòä
