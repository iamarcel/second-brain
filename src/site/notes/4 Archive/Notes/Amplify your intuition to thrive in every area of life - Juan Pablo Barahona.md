It's amazing at Mindvalley, even though we don't know each other we're already so close.

What is your highest truth? Are you connected to it?

I lose so much time trying to meditate in a certain way. Not realizing it's all inside of me.

**It's about me surrendering to the energy that's already flowing through me.**

We need to realize the art is everywhere. But the science is equally important, and it helps is go deeper.

When something resonates with you, take time to feel how it flows through you.

## Curious, raw and real
We've all had this experience where it was a “no” deep inside, we did it anyways and felt afterwards, yeah that was right.

“Wait, no. Right now I'm feeling angry. And that's okay.“

Be that raw and real: I'm feeling sad. Be present completely but process the pain.

Say this if you're not feeling what your SO is asking you to do: **Sorry babe I need to respect this feeling. When I'm with you I'll be completely present with you but right now I need to do this.**

Holding your breath after deep breaths helps unclog old patterns.

Move the spine to charge cerebrospinal fluid.

## Come back to your natural state 
Pineal Gland: inner Compass. Connecting with internal knowing. Also love vibration energies.

Piezoelectric effect wakes up the bebzodiazepines (which they sell in farmacies).

Awake DMT with breathwork and meditation.

Story of seeing a girl. Ego wants to show off and the feeling stays being “no.” juanpa no don't do it!!!

**It's about presence, all of it. That's it guys.**

## Eye of Horus
Symbol is in the shape of the brain. Crystal palace.

Relax the pineal gland with relaxation and meditation. Then it opens up and vibrates at 40Hz.

Pineal gland collects chlorine and fluoride in water etc. creates a crystal, not a good one.

Grounding: barefoot connection with the earth. In nature.

**Sungazing: just after sunrise of before sunset.**

Surrender to the phase of meditation where you forget what to do.

Bath of borax.

Chaga mushroom very high in antioxidant.

## Spanda
Connection with vibration, the universe is vibrating through you. Term from tantra.

# Regan Hillyer
**We are made of light.**

We are not separate from what's happening to the earth. There have never been as much solar flares.

Activate the conscious millionaire. Look at money in a deep way. Surrender into service. Show heart. Be bold and courageous enough.

These are not affirmations but portals into your self.

## I choose to be a conscious millionaire
**Be with the reality really intensely for a long time first.**

Actually getting it feels normal.

Have you precisely chosen where you want to be?

## I choose to raise my level of tolerance
We get our minimum standard.
Shit will go wrong, don't tolerate but raise it for more. 

If you have a goal that excites you, that enlivens you, it's that it has already happened in your future.

Your soul is whispering to you. Are you listening?

## I easily expand my capacity to receive large amounts of money
You can only receive what you are capable of holding.

If you had it tomorrow, where would it be allocated. What would the containers be?

self worth + millionaire consciousness = accelerated receiving

**You need to know deep down you're worthy of receiving this.**

Do it every day until you have a deep knowing you're so deserving that it's obvious.

## I clear and release anything that is stopping me
If you're not there yet meditate on what bas been stopping you now.

What would abundance do? What would abundance know?

Take stock of your families’ systems. What are their beliefs?

Not about being a robot that's perfect with money. It's about being human, living with it, letting go what should go.

## I am a conscious millionaire, now
The future of you that has already walked your path is available to you right now.

Learn from them how they behave, walk, talk, show up, environments. What do they say yes or no to?

You probably won't notice until you end up there and realized then it was intuition.

**This is an invitation into the work.**

Money is in a relationship with all of us. How is that going for you?

**If money was a human, what would they think of you?**

The core of money is pure universal abundance. It just wants to show up and help you give more to the world.

Don't forget about it. Be there for them

## I use environment as an intentional tool to accelerate wealth
This is everything. Do all the people around you make you more powerful?

Consciously create an environment where people love your light. Like going here in Mindvalley.

## I am an energetic match for multiple millions
It's an energy, it's a vibe.

Have a manifestation alarm on your phone. Stop, close your eyes and tap into the feeling of having already received the money.

Doing it from a place of ease and flow.

## My three brains are integrated, in alignment and are always supporting me

- mind brain
- heart brain (alignment to source, info is filtered)
- gut brain (inner wisdom)

If these are not in alignment it won't work.

Simple check in: heart brain, how does that feel, this amount of money? What concerns do you have? You'll be surprised at the detail of the response.

## I choose to upgrade into a stabilized field of impact, embodying a balanced give and receive cycle

Levels:
1. Survival
2. Freedom of self
3. Contribution to inner community
4. Contribution to outer community
5. Contribution to global community

You have to sort out these layers in this order.

## I embody the frequency of manifesting millions
It happens in micromoments. Realize that abundance is infinite.

It's an inner game.
You can spend months on each of these.

What I know for sure guys is that we need you. We need people like you to do this work.

# Q&A
Confused between rational and feeling? **Do to feel.** Listen. Change state and ask your heart again.

Create multiple alignments. **The big picture goal but also one for the next month. Microgoals.** MW this is kind of like Tiago Forte’s Project scope

Get in the flow state for me. Have strong habits but be okay breaking it. What if your new habit was listening to the soul and acting from that every single day?

What are you unconsciously committing to? The next level of money or vibration with guilt, or a weird sense of staying in rapport.

Search for what your soul says. When you start speaking from there, it will connect differently. ==**Don't say no to your parents from a rebellious space, say no from a deep connection with your soul and knowing of what is right for you.**== No longer the rebel, your father will feel it.

That part that wants to be acknowledged has to die. Your friends they're there for an *image* of you.

Practice sovereign energy: holding your own space energetically and not letting it be too influenced by the energies around you. MW [[4 Archive/Imported/Mindvalley - Duality\|Mindvalley - Duality]] permission rose comes to mind here
