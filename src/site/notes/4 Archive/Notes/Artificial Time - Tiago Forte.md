The rise of Big Data allowed us to store everything, and figure out what to do with it later. A more recent and even more powerful invention – machine learning – now allows us to analyze and draw conclusions from more data than any number of humans could ever comprehend.

Carlsen was the first chess world champion to have trained primarily against sophisticated chess AIs available on personal computers as he grew up in the 2000s.

As a result, his playing style was different from any human that came before him.

In a very real sense, Carlsen is an **AI-augmented** player.

“**cognitive prosthetics**,” we can raise our effective experiential age and go beyond the limits of time ourselves.

**AIs have escaped natural time**, and are now sensing, recording, generating, and digesting history at the rate of decades or centuries per week.

You are not living as a witness to the rise of Artificial Intelligence. **You are living as an agent augmented by Artificial Time.** You are living at the end of history, and entering an accelerated future created by machines.
