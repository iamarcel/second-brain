What is astral projection?
- Going into the formless, removing limitations from the self
- Meditation, move out of own body, move around however

Study of transpersonal psychology. There they call it *exceptional human experience*.

Types of OBE ([[Out-of-Body Experience\|Out-of-Body Experience]])
- Evolutionary, at a point in life when self-actualization is needed; what I teach in the quest
- Provoked, spontaneous 
- Self-initiated

Ancient traditions used to train for years to meet their masters at the other side of the Hymalaian, find out where herds were, lose fear of death.

CIA & Monroe Institute. Tracks in the quest are from there.

Irrational OBE fears: possessed, die, something else. 

If we get too scared or too excited we jump out of the OBE immediately.

Story of a woman who did not have a full OBE. Could not see it but feel that she wasn't on herself.

There might be a guardian or threshold when learning to test you. Surrender to it.

You cannot astral project unless you are very embodied. It's paradoxical I know. This is the difference between the mystic and the madman.

I was a dance and dance therapy teacher.
