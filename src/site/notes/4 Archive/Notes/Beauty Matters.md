That was not just some ink splattered on a slab of dead tree.

It *pulled* me in.

Suddenly I stopped worrying about how she would react to my text, I stopped brainstorming about what I could eat tonight, and I stopped hearing the techno that leaked through the headphones of the guy next to me. Everything was gone.

This is what beauty does to you.

Whether we realize or not, we're all looking for more beauty—but when it comes to creation it takes a backseat.

We buy Apple products because they're so beautiful—so we can create an online course with a shitty webcam that we upload straight to Loom.

We meticulously curate our focus playlists on Spotify—so we can smash out illegible emails or cookie-cutter AI-generated content in 3 seconds.

We travel to Bali so we can overlook the gorgeous nature while we're typing out the ugliest Google Doc the world has ever seen.

It's nuts.

Throughout history, humans have been captivated by beauty—whether in art, nature, or each other. But today it seems like the world is obsessed with the 80/20 rule, striving for Ultimate Efficiency at the expense of everything else.

Just look around you in any modern city. Plain, square, concrete slabs of buildings. Ornaments securely kept as relics of the past, to be admired but never reproduced. Even modern art eschews decades of hard work over paint splatters.

Only my friends from ex-USSR countries seem to notice that...this isn't really the way we want to live.

We want to live surrounded by beauty.

We want to experience being lifted up by beautiful stories, carried by beautiful music and we want to rest our eyes on beautiful places, humans and things.

As entrepreneurs, we are creators. We are actively shaping this world so I believe it's our responsibility to bring more beauty into it.

Put in more effort than the 20% and turn your work into something you're really proud of.

Learn the basics of aesthetics, graphic design and photography so every part of your business is *on point*.

Use your money to give back and support artists.

Let's take a stand and strive for a better world. Let's put in just a little more effort so what we make is more than enough.

It's what the world needs right now.
