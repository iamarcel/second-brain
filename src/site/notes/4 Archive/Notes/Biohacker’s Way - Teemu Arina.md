Make a couple of beveragesz throwing a ton of stuff in coffee.

Whatever you repeat, matters.

Understand yourself as a cybernetic system. Stuff goes into stuff goes out.

500 page book. Exercise, nutrition, sleep, work, health.

In athletic work and in learning the most important performance gains come from the rest time.

Biohacking is health and performance optimization. You don't *need* the tech but it helps.

As a biohacker I'm interested in problems in 10-20 years down the road. In the current sick care system we don't think about this.

Genetics, blood work, analysis, up to predictive healthcare.

It is cheaper to increase health than to treat sickness.

I sometimes make a tea base instead of coffee from Chaga.

Grass-fed is not the highest standard, wild is better. That's why I like to use butter from Estonia, the cows use all kinds of things.

Chili is thermogenic, opens capillaries.
Ginseng improves blood sugar even more.
Cinnamon stops blood sugar spice after 15-30%.

Limitless Coffee are pre-blended coffees.

Open up capsules and taste it to see if it's sawdust.

Lions mane increases growth factor in the brain.

Be very careful with curcumin, they add lead for the weight. BCA95 extract.

Chaga pulls out tree stuff into the fruiting body.

They blend it in a Nutribullet, interesting. Pay attention to the blowing up.
