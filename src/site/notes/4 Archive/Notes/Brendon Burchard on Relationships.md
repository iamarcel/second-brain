Have a scheduled state of the union.


Superpowers exercise has to be in a rhythm: tell each others' superpowers on a walk.

Gratitude appreciation admiration
Give examples of the superpowers you praise in them

Daily reminder to praise your partner. Brendon has this in his phone.

I set the pace. Don’t want fairness. Bring to the relationship what you want it to have.

Question on the walk. What do you wish would change for the next level of our relationship? Let her have her list. Don’t get defensive.

Hopeful change. "I would love for you to be nicer to yourself." Sleep more. I want positive changes for your life, not to please me.
**Want good things for your partner, *for them*.**

> If you want anything from your partner, ask them to become their best. In their own definition.

Your partner is not
Your healer
Your therapist
Your spiritual guide
If you expect them you’re just adding harm
Is your responsibility. If they help great but it is yours.

They are not your servant

Compliance is not the path to intimacy.

Be aware of bitterness when you serve your partner.

They are not your accountability partner.
The more I keep me on track in life the sexier I am.
Ask them to keep you on track and you will lose respect.



The job is for both of you to seek wholeness in your own life.

"I hate *you complete me*." If I need you to close me out, I'm always going to spin out.

When I'm full and whole in myself, I'm not needy.
