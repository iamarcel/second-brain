[[4 Archive/Notes/Brendon Burchard on Finding Fulfillment in Life - GrowthDay\|Brendon Burchard on Finding Fulfillment in Life - GrowthDay]]

We have four categories or purpose: Self, Social, Skill, Service.

One of our purposes is *who we are*. I believe we have a purpose to grow into who we want to be. To actualize into the best of who we are, to find better ways to understand and express that, to live in integrity with that.

We also derive purpose from social relationships: live feels purposeful because I'm a good sun/brother/husband/role model.

We find purpose in what we bring to the world.

When people say I don't know my purpose, they haven't found self, social, skill and service things that make it *feel fulfilling*.

We also want a sense of *growth* in these aspects.
