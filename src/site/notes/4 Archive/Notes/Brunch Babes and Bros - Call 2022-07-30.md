## Marcel’s audio setup
Desktop setup:
- Scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface (2-channel for if I want to podcast with 2 people in the future, there’s a 1-channel too)
- XM8500 microphone (cheap but great)
- XLR cable
- Microphone arm with desk clamp
- Some cable ties

Recommendation for basically all of this in one microphone, so it’s portable (and you can use it as a camera microphone): [Rode VideoMic NTG](https://rode.com/en/microphones/on-camera/videomic-ntg).

The advantage of the “big” setup is mainly how standardized it is and that you can swap out separate pieces. It’s also a headphone DAC so if you would ever get fancy headphones, this can make sure they sound great. It’s also cheaper than the single microphone.

The single microphone is very portable—easy to use with a laptop. It’s also a regular camera microphone so if you want that it’s got it built-in. I think it’s a DAC too but will obviously be not as good as the Focusrite just because it’s so small.

- Send a nice voice message

## Sam’s Exercise: What’s the 3 things you *have* to have in your morning routine
Evening Routine inspiration: letter from your future self to your current self thanking yourself for what you’re doing now.

Sam: pray every morning and evening. Touching my cross immediately brings me to presence, gratitude. It seems to open everything up. I can just sit there and think, fuck I live an amazing life. I do it all the time. When an ambulance passes.

## What’s changed
Sam: More masculinity, doing what I want. My mom says I’m more snappy. Been needing a lot of sleep.

Bebecita: I’m no longer anxious at all. More grateful for the things I have. More kind with myself. Dancing more. Phone wallpaper: look, you’re already happy. Experienced inducing the sadness in dancing.

Valentina: I was first afraid MVU was a bubble. It’s the total opposite. Part of me is not afraid anymore to speak up anymore. Life doesn’t end with the success you get easily. No longer afraid to takl about difficult topics, be honest. I reassured that the decisions I made were the right ones. I’m rebuilding my approach to productivity. I realize now my unhappiness was because I had a calling.

Never update your vision boards before MVU, you’ll have double work.

Don’t try to do two things at once. You feel less stressed when you’re only doing one thing.

> You are miles and _miles_ ahead of millions of people. The things you do casually, people don't know how to do that.

In life book categories, link them to related books.

If you’re proud of it, please share it.

If it goes to Notion, it needs to be nicely organized.

### Lau’s system
Almost all on paper notebooks.

Year goals written down, and life areas.

On Sunday, pick goals to work on this week. Pick areas to work on.

Another notebook with most important daily task.

Book for tracking what I eat, tracking knww recovery and now holistic, creative writing notebook. I feel very connected to physical paper.

### Sam’s System
Write in Google, Screenshot, I look at my camera roll in the morning anyways so I’ll definitely see it.

How do you feel? With a list of emotions. Helps you reflect on what you’re actually feeling, and why you’re feeling this way.

Steven Kotler: push yourself, push yourself, push yourself Then when you feel like you’re burning out, just go and do *nothing*.

Balance between being practical and loving life.
