ChatGPT is the cheapest, fastest way to access intelligence on-demand. Think of it like an intern with an infinite amount of time, but they managed to bend spacetime so a day of their work is finished in a few seconds.

Even though they learned almost all information available on the internet, large language models are not that good at reliably finding the exact information you need.

They are *reasoning* engines, not *search* engines.

So their true power is unlocked once you give your own information. This could be summarized notes, outlines you've already written or existing frameworks.

That's what we'll do today. We'll use some great existing frameworks and get ChatGPT to be our creative thinker. We're in the driver's seat but the AI is doing much of the work.

## One Product Framework
Things to notice about this prompt:
- I didn't really know the framework
- I copy-pasted some transcript from a podcast
- I gave multiple instructions, in order: explain the framework, then walk me through and interview me

```
What was the one avatar one channel one product framework by Alex Hormozi? Can you explain the entire framework?

This is his explanation from an interview:

    Interviewer: If somebody is starting from scratch, what are the traits, and skillsets they should be cultivating in order to up the odds of their success?

    Alex: They should focus on one thing in general rather than lots of things that they’re not sure about. Coz if they’re starting about, everything waits for a second opportunity. So, the correct answer is, all of them are opportunities. But, all of them won’t work unless you pick one. Right?

    So, boom, pick one. And then from there, I’ll say, six figures is; sell something to someone. That’s it. And if you want more details, sell something to someone. So, it’s one avatar, one product, one channel. So, you don’t have to figure out; how do I create 20 pieces of content across…? It’s like, just pick one channel, one media source — facebook, Instagram, whatever, Twitter, consistently going out on that. Whether it’s cold app, running content, affiliates, word of mouth, whatever it is. Start reaching out to people that help you sell your stuff. And if you can just do that consistently… you’ll succeed.

Coach:

```
I want you to be my business coach that helps me fill in this framework. Please ask me questions to collect all the necessary information. Ask one question at a time, I will answer it.
```

## Customer Research
```
I want you to take the role of 3 potential customers and answer the following questions in their name. Make sure they open up, focus on feelings, and that I can make up where the possible shortcomings or strong points of the offer are. Make sure they open up about their emotions, frustrations, dreams, what it would mean for them and maybe an idea or two.

- Would you be interested in this offer; why or why not?
- What would you change about this offer?
- What have you tried in the past to solve this or a similar problem? list blogs, posts, books or courses you have tried.
- What frustrated you most when it comes to this space?
- If you could wave a magic wand, what would that look like?

## Copywriting
```
Let's introduce a new style of writing called EPSW (Emotional Persuasive StoryWriting). Stories written in this style are highly emotional, forming a connection where the reader feels like they're in the shoes of the subject of the story, and have an emotional rollercoaster that goes to deep pain and then back up through a transformation. Finally, in the end it transitions to introducing some product or service that was responsible for the transformation.

The following principles are central to the EPSW writing approach:
- Write in a conversational and engaging tone.
- Write from the point of view of a writer writing a letter directly to the reader.
- Make it highly personal.
- Know the reader (audience) and understand their desires.
- Be clear and concise.
- Use words that evoke emotion and create desire.
- Provide evidence to support claims.
- Focus on the benefits.
- Be honest and trustworthy.
- Use powerful visuals.
- Don't be loud and flashy.
- Respect the intelligence of your reader.
- Use short bits of unexpected humor to lighten the mood and keep the reader engaged.
- Always tell stories. Story, story, story.

Content in the EPSW writing style follows this structure:

- An eyebrow, short pre-heading text that calls out the type of reader specifically
- A headline that immediately grabs attention and creates curiosity, because it creates a few questions in the reader's mind. This should be a counterintuitive statement.
- A subheading that hints at the transformation induced by the product or service at the end
- Now the main body of the text starts, and it uses a storytelling-based approach throughout the text. Both longer stories and shorter anecdotes.
- The body starts off by connecting the reader with a deep pain they feel. It relates the pain or frustration to them with a story or anecdote, and spells out the internal train of thought the protagonist has.
- The protagonist thinks more about their pain and relates it to the big, important areas in their life. Things like their happiness, relationships, health, wealth. They exacerbate this pain and internal negative train of thought.
- Now, the text transitions to educating the reader. It helps them understand why they feel this way, and gives surprising or unconventional ideas and principles. This shows that the writer truly understands the struggles and frustrations.
- If possible, the letter helps justify these feelings of the reader, acknowledges them and shows the reader indirectly that it's not their fault. It refers to external factors that are the blame.
- At this point, a story of transformation begins. It could be from the point of view of the writer, or from someone else. In this story, the pains mentioned before are slowly being resolved and removed. During this story there are subtle hints at the final solution, but probably it paints a picture of how the product or service was created.
- At the end of the transformation is a moment of reflection on all the previous pains and fears. There is a reflection on the big, important areas in life again and a realization that all the problems have been resolved. This paints an image of a wonderful future in a perfect world.
- Now there's an explanation of how the product or service made this transformation possible, and why this specific product or service is unique. It transitions to an offer, and ends with a strong call to action.

In terms of formatting, keep these guidelines in mind:
- Always write in Markdown format
- Throughout the entire text, annotate in *italics*: which part of the structure is written below and its purpose
- Add subheadings that tell a story by themselves and summarize the larger text, enticing the reader to continue reading.

## Images
```
The sections of my sales page have images in the background and I am using Midjourney to generate them. It's an image generation model that takes a detailed list of keywords as prompt to generate an appropriate image. Give me three prompts. Make sure you include the subject, environment, image style, feeling, and many details about the image.

Combine all elements of each prompt into a single block.
