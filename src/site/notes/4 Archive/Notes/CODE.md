# Capture
Capture only the ideas and insights that are truly noteworthy. They will move you on a physical level.

Do not only capture external information, capture your own ideas too.

Keep track of your 12 favorite problems and look at the world through that lens.

# Organize
Use [[0 Inbox/PARA\|PARA]]. People need clear workspaces to be able to create.

# Distill
Find the essence.

When we talk to very important people, we don’t waste their time and be as succinct as possible. What if our future self was as important as these VIPs?

1. Captured notes
2. Bolded passages
3. Highlighted passages
4. Executive summary

Summarize to the next level when you are *reading* a note. Then you’re really sure you actually need the note.

# Express
It’s about **expressing our ideas earlier**, more frequently and in smaller chunks to test what works and gather feedback from others. That **feedback in turn gets drawn in to your Second Brain**, where it becomes the starting point for the next iteration of your work.
