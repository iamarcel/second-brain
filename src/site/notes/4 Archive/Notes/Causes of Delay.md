Why do we, even when we know things we have to do, goals we are chasingâ€”why do we not tackle them?

Lack of Clarity:
- In the process to move to the thing they want
- On the payoff, not sure what the reward would be

Fear
- What if it doesn't work out?
- What if it's too hard?
- I fear I don't have the support
- What if I don't have the resources, time, energy, money, reserves emotionally, time

These are *convenient* and they can be true.

But the true cause is: **self-esteem**. The belief in our own worth, capabilities, value.
