Cold exposure, through a shower or better yet, an ice bath, is great for your health. It improve the immune response and lowers inflammation. [[Wim Hof\|Wim Hof]]

Cold exposure lowers your dopamine when you're in it (because you don't want to) but research has shown that after, it actually *upregulates* dopamine for multiple hours. [[Andrew Huberman\|Andrew Huberman]]

This is a great motivational tool: starting the day off showing yourself that yes, you can really push through and do something you don't want to do.
