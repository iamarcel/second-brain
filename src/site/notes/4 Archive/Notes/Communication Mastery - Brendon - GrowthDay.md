## There is no easy way

Story of practicing speaking, girl, overtime.

**You have more than one chance.** You gotta put in the reps.

Mastery requires practice.

You have to put in the reps. Be willing to fail.

**Your quality of life is proportional to how often you can deal with difficult situations.**

The girl never talked to me again.
- All the women in the room "oh nooo"
- All the guys: yeah happens all the time

In my first job, every meeting, I asked if I could talk.

Spoke at every koana club. They had a national meeting, they invited me to be the keynote speaker.

## Not about you.

The speech isn't about you.

The more you make it about you the more you're in your insecurities and the less you'll connect with the audience.

Example: ask to speak to the top 10 leaders and interview them about their struggles. Talk to the struggling clubs. "What are some phrases you use? What are the inside clubs?"

Speak their language.

The whole speech built on their hopes and pain points.

Most speakers don't break through because they don't know the audience.

## The 3 Objectives

### Demonstrate compassion

A significant amount of the speech needs to be in their world with a tone of compassion.

I understand, here's my story. I understand your shared experiences.

Slow it down, talk about our challenges.

### Challenge

Challenge with the same universals. Things we all have difficulty with.

"You know, sometimes ... and we have to do something about it."

### Connect the audience

What is the agenda for them moving together?

Listenâ€”let's all go hard together.

So the group goes yeahhh awesome let's do this!

## Freedom

You're out of your head, you can just talk to the people.

It feels different when you care about them and you can still just do you.

Be free in your movement. Walk around.

**Talk to people like you would talk to them in a barbecue in your backyard** (one you *want* to have).

**Your level of success is highly dependent on how much you need people to approve you.**

Ask the CEO: "What would you want an external to tell the audience that you can't say but you can't because it's politically incorrect, or it's too harsh, or it wouldn't feel good?"

It's not about not having the doubt. It's about still going when you have doubt.

Walk at a *normal* speed, not super slow speech speed.

Always end in a crescendo.
