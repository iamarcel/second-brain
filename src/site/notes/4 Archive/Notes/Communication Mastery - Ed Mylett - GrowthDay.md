Young people: you're here for a *flicker*. Whatever dreams you have, go chase them. It doesn't matter, all the failures.

You're always making people feel *something*. So be intentional about what they're going to feel.

One thing Ed's really good at: in a very short amount of time seeing what they're really good at, connecting that to something they know about themselves, and connecting that to why they're going to winâ€”this is how you give them confidence.

"Yeah you can clap for that it's pretty cool."

I tell my son every single day, "Max you're the best you're a champion, a warrior, you're so kind, everybody loves you I love you so much..."

What I'm trying to make you feel is make you seen, understood, strong.
