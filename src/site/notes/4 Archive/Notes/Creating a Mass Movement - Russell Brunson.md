Main Ingredients:
- Charismatic Leader or Attractive Character
- Focus on a future-based goal that's bigger than yourself
- Offer your audience an opportunity

This is about creating your [[1000 True Fans|1000 True Fans]].

# Charismatic Leader / Attractive Character
The successful experts have an internal pull to want to serve and help people. It's like a **voice inside of them telling them they're destined for greatness**.

==You have the ability and the responsibility to help others== with your gifts, whatever they are.

All you have to do is be one step ahead of your students.

Serve your True Believers.

Complement the other players in your market; make them partners instead of competitors. Pull people from the market into your niche.

Questions to find True Believers:
- Would people in the (sub)market be excited about the new opportunity I'm presenting in my niche?
- Are the people in this market irrationally passionate?
	- Communities
	- Vocabulary
	- Events
	- Other Experts. You don't want to be the first celebrity in a market.
- Are these people willing and able to spend money on information?

**People are silently begging to be led.**

## Become an attractive character, and live the life your audience wishes they could live.
See [[Dotcom Secrets - Russell Brunson|Dotcom Secrets - Russell Brunson]].

People will follow you because you have completed the journey they are on right now. It can be scary to become vulnerable and show your backstories as well as your life now, but it's the key to becoming a leader that will inspire people to change.

## Maintain Absolute Certainty
**The person with the most certainty wins.**

It begins with **sharing your message often so you can find your voice and become certain** in what you're teaching. When you first start, you're not posting for your audience, you're posting for you.

## Don't Be Boring
Your audience must be fascinated with you and what you teach.

All successful experts are ==**highly prolific and have abundant inventiveness**==. They invent new, unique ideas all the time. The Prolific Index is **just enough away from the mainstream**, not so crazy that you completely dismiss it.

Cause some polarity. By creating true fans, you will always upset those on the other side.

If you haven't offended someone by noon each day, you're not marketing hard enough.

## Understand How To Use Persuasion
> **People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions, and help them throw rocks at their enemies.**

Take the blame for their past failures.
Put their fears to rest and give them hope.
One of our favorite things to say is "I knew it."

## Care... A LOT
It's essential to their success that they pay you. The more they pay, the more attention they will pay.

## Offer value from their perceived relationship with you
It's more about *you* than the *things*.
Sometimes they just want to get to know you.

# The Cause
The charismatic leader paints a picture of the future they are trying to create and what life will be like when they get there.

People want to plug in to something bigger than themselves, so it's your job to create that vision.

- Where can they place their hope and faith?
	- e.g. "you're just one funnel away..." (left it open for interpretation since it's different for everyone)
	- Imagine you're running for president and think about what the slogan would be for your campaign.
- Help them break their 4-minute mile
	- Show how you achieved something
	- Show how others got there too
- Let them self-identify
	- People need to be able to identify with who they are in your group
	- "I'm a ..."
- Create your own Title of Liberty

## Title of Liberty
A rallying call.

### The Mini Manifesto
For example, a phone background with a few sentences.

### The Manifesto
A longer one-pager.

### Video Title Sequence
- Identify the charismatic leader
- Identify the movement
- Us vs. them
	- Take a stand.
	- Why are you different?
	- Who or what are you collectively fighting against?
	- Who you are

# The New Opportunity (Vehicle of Change)
This is by far the most important, yet least understood, part of the process.

==Don't fix what's not working, **replace it with something better.**==

People don't want improvement offers:
- Improvement is hard.
- It's for ambitious people. Most people have desire but no ambition.
- Memories of poor past decisions. If your followers are in need of improvement, they must first admit failure.
- Commodity pricing.

If you can't be the cheapest, become the most expensive. There's no advantage of being the second cheapest.

==**Status is the only thing that causes people to move.**==

Buying might lead to a status decrease. Universal status increasers:
- Appearance of intelligence
- Appearance of wealth, power, or happiness
- Physical appearance (weight loss, make-up, supplements)
- Style (e.g., Mac vs PC)

People want replacement offers:
- New discovery.
- No pain of disconnect.
- Dream replacement.
- Greener pastures.

Either opportunity *switch* or opportunity *stack*. Within your portfolio, don't switch as it creates confusion. Instead make it one switch and then stack.
