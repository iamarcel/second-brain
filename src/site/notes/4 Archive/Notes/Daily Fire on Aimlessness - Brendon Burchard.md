1. You're not thinking anymore

Consumption drowns out your ambition and your thinking.

Very little people *think* anymore. If they have any free second they consume and scroll instead.

I think most people aren't aimless, they just don't spend enough time *thinking* about purpose, *thinking* about how they can be of purpose.

1. Is your ego preventing you from engaging?

This is, fear of what other people are going to think.

Most people *do* know what they want to do. *You're not aimless, you're just lacking some courage*.

All good things in life come through courage.

1. Feel daily fulfillment

What you're doing is going somewhere.
You served a little.
