Turning content from a stream into knowledge in a [[2 Areas/Second Brain\|Digital Garden]]. Reverse of [[4 Archive/Notes/Re-streaming\|Re-streaming]].

We ingest information necessarily in a *stream*, as time move forwards, only forwards, and all the time. But timeless knowledge and our brains are structured like a *graph*, a *garden*, timeless topics connected in some way.

Concept from [[4 Archive/Notes/The Garden and the Stream - A Technopastoral\|The Garden and the Stream - A Technopastoral]].
