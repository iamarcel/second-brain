### Show up meditation
Meditate and ask what one action you can take now that's good for your body.
Then meditate on being happy with your body as it is now.

## Peak experiences are often “unhealthy”
When you build health, you move through these levels:
1. Unhealthy
2. Get healthy > Healthy but fragile
3. Get fit > Healthy and robust

When you're at level 3, you can have less sleep and your crispy chili chicken once in a while and still survive.

Enjoy food with flexibility: strength training and intermittent fasting.

Clear out toxins: HIIT, sauna, breathwork.

Recover from undersleeping: mindfulness.

Enjoy adventures: functional training.

## Fitness looks radically different for each person
Some bodies are made for aesthetics, some for CNS balance, some for functionality.

9% body fat is a golden amount for men.

Your natural state is one of the reasons to focus on High-Efficiency fitness: for some goals you just have to work *too hard* and it's not worth it.

Do a DNA test to understand your body traits.

Choose fitness goals according to least resistance. You need to try different routines to start understanding this.

## Human connection is the trump card
Sense of community has a huge huge effect on your health.

**Is your relationship with your body improving or impairing your relationship with others?**

## Mastery is in the fundamentals
Basically all the transformation happens with things we already know.

Assess your fundamentals once a quarter.

Hire a coach to help you keep this on track

## Transforming the body is about a relationship
Listen to your body. Talk with it.
