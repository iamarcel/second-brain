When we try to treat people with addiction, we work on their emotions. But usually with discipline, we try to make people "push through." So it seems like this negative emotions, we know they have specific places in the brain, but positive emotions? What are they? This is where the yogic teachers really figured something out.

**Opposites are in the same category.** (hot/cold, red/blue are in the same category) Doubt, or a wavering mind, is the opposite of discipline.

Doubt <-> Resolve.

**Don't cultivate discipline, cultivate resolve.** Then what the patient ends up behaving like, is *disciplined*.

Habits are pretty fixed.
Willpower runs out.
What does change is emotions. That's consistent with our "discipline."

The feeling of:
"I'm gonna pass this class."
"I'm done with this person."
"I'm NEVER gonna play another league of legends again."

A lot of positive emotions come from *circuits* not anatomical structures.

Functions in the brain can come freom 2 places:
- An anatomical structure, a specific place
- A circuit, a series of connections

Positive emotions come from circuits.

So to cultivate discipline, **cultivate resolve on a daily basis.**

## How to cultivate resolve

1. Notice when you feel resolve.

Take a snapshot of how it feels.

2. Sankalpa (small to practice).

The practice is to develop a sankalpa.

Pick one thing you want to be resolved towards.
Start by picking a Medium Difficulty thing. (It's about *practice* at this point.)
Every day when you wake up, within the first 1h-1h30 sit down and think about that resolve. **Stoke up the resolve inside of you.**
Give the resolve a calm space and it will grow.

3. Daily emotional cultivation on a harder thing (after 30 days)

The next step, give it more emotional space.
E.g., "I deserve to be whole."
As many days as you can manage, think about the resolve and let the emotions come up like a fire.

## What gets in the way?

**People who are undisciplined, are numb.**

Some people have difficulty because they're alexithymic.
