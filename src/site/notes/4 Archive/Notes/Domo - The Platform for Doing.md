Domo = Do More.
You might describe this as a Coach as a Service (CaaS).

Domo changes the stakes when it comes to managing your life or business. It takes the basic idea of task management and transforms it into a complete system to make you better.

- **Context.** Tasks are never alone. They have a source (goal, vision, purpose, project) and a result.
- **Progress.** Tasks shouldn't disappear in the void of nothingness as soon as they're completed.

# The Domo Manifesto
You're creating things. You're making things happen. That's awesome.

You have purposes and goals. You need to focus on them regularly to go at full speed to where you want to go.

Planning and scheduling make doing so much easier.

Doing is often about pulling together multiple things. We'll help you with that.

# Introducing Context
Context is made up of the crucial *things* that surround the act of doing. It can take many forms:

- **The Why.** Where is this task coming from? Breadcrumbs from your purpose, to areas, to goals, to projects.
- **The How.** Your support layer that helps you execute this task. Pointers to required documentation, previous work, implementation details; but also to get to the exact place where execution should happen. (e.g., link to open email or development environment)
- **The What.** Results of execution. Progress towards a goal, lessons learned, memories to cherish, new notes or insights, something physical created, the next action.

With an extensive API, Domo can become your Execution Hub. Tasks can be auto-created and inline snippets of other applications can let you execute on tasks without losing focus on the big picture. (Something like [[Microsoft Fluid Components\|Microsoft Fluid Components]])

# Life Progress
**Backwards.** Having your Why linked to tasks enables tracking of the areas in your life (and even how much you're executing on each of your values). You can visualize increased XP ([[HoliGamE\|HoliGamE]] style).

**Forwards.** Pick a subset of purposes/values/categories to work on in the coming time frame to narrow down activities. Get an overview graph of what parts of life you'll be moving forwards in.

**Bi-directional.** Recommended areas that didn't get much attention lately.
