In productivity, the work you’ve finished is finished forever. It doesn't matter that you stuck to the same tool all the time.

If we can use simple tools like Dopamine Stacking to get us through periods of low motivation, we should have them as part of our toolkit. It’s not lazy; it’s intelligent.

## Here are some low cost ways to dopamine stack:

- Switching to a new environment
- Trying a new todo list
- Switching from paper to digital notes
- Switching from digital notes to paper
- Switching to a new work schedule
- Fasting in the morning
- Switching from coffee to tea

You can dopamine stack in two ways:
- Any time you feel your energy flagging, try something new.
- Rotate through tools, systems, and environments on a schedule.


## Each time we switch we give ourselves a fresh guilt-free start, and we’d get the motivation increased associated with using a new tool.

If we stack one source of newness on top of another all of the time, we might be able to sustain higher levels of productivity and motivation than if we just tried to force ourselves to buckle down.

We could call it Dopamine Stacking.
