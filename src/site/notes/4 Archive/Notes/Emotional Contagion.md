Our emotions can be influenced by those of the people around me.

We have to learn to feel independently from them.

We feel a pull to mimic other's energy: mirror neurons.
Then we want to *interact* with them, and sometimes the way we interact is not good.

When there are heightened emotions around you, gauge whether that's impacting you.

- Determine the identity you're going to have ([[Role Model Mindset\|Role Model Mindset]])
- Stay present in your body, mind and energy (MW /reminds me of [[Permission Rose\|Permission Rose]])
- Decide an intention. What does it serve you to get involved, and if you do, with what intention?
- Allow yourself to take a break from other people's emotions
