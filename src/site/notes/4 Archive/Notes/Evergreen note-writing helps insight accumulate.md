[[4 Archive/Notes/Evergreen Note\|Evergreen Note]] are the place where [[4 Archive/Notes/Leap of Insight\|Leap of Insight]] can happen. 

Consider some hypothetical leap of insight you’d like to be able to make. To make that leap, you’ll typically need to evolve many independent, partially-formed ideas simultaneously, until they suddenly converge in a flash of inspiration. If you need to iterate on more than a few pieces at once, you may struggle to keep them all in your head.

Yet **each note you write represents an increment in your thinking** about that specific idea, and each note enriches the broader network of links. [[4 Archive/Notes/Better note-taking vs better thinking\|Better note-taking vs better thinking]].
