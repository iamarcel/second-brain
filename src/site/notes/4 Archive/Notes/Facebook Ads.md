# Guidelines
We usually start our CBOâ€™s at $100 a day. But the budget needs to be high enough to exit the learning phase but low enough that FB still tries to find you the cheapest conversions.
  
Let it run for longer than 24 hours (results in the first 24 hours will most likely suck).

When you have a CBO that works instead of increasing the budget duplicate the CBO and make one tweak at the ad set level.
