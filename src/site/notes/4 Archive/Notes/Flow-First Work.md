Basically a manifesto for the Gardener way of working.
Be rooted when working.
JIT organization. [[0 Inbox/Just-In-Time Planning|Just-In-Time Planning]]
[[Personal Productivity Network|Personal Productivity Network]]
[[Pipelining|Pipelining]]
[[Out-of-Order Execution|Out-of-Order Execution]]

Spectrums of:
- Level of organization
- Length of work session required for types of work ([[4 Archive/Imported/Intermediate Packets|Intermediate Packets]])

Why? Freedom. No more anxiety about either losing stuff or losing time organizing.

Flow-first work is mostly about setting up distraction outlet valves, and surrounding it with a clear takeoff and landing procedure.
- Tools with inboxes
- Free-text unstructured notepad
- Reminders to close the valves again
- A trusted landing signal
- Agreements with yourself
	- Boundaries of what to do
	- Pre-flight checklist
	- Practice staying in focus
