Watched [[4 Archive/Notes/Ali Abdaal\|Ali Abdaal]]'s summary of the book.

Because we have clocks, this makes us keep track of time a bit obsessively.

The more we split up our day, the more it starts to feel like this conveyor belt of boxes that we have to fill up efficiently. So we make allegedly the most of our life.

## Time Problems
- Online Distraction
- Not feeling Fulfillment
- Decision Paralysis

The most stereotypical book is going to imply you can get everything done you would want to, provided you can render yourself optimally efficient.

**No, you don't have time for all the things that matter.**

Yes, you might fail at doing the things that matter.

> The future appeals more to use than the present moment because it appears to us in a multitude of pleasant forms all at the same time. â€“ Henri Bergson


## In Denial
We use two methods to go in denial about how many things we can get done.

### Clearing the decks
Putting off big tasks that get us to our goals and clear the decks of small but urgent tasks that "need to get out of our way first because we need focus."

### Submitting to distraction
The truth is that most of us are willing accomplices in our own distraction.

Distractions are, yes, well-engineered, but ultimately just a way to face relief from the discomfort of facing our own fears.

**Your whole job can be a distraction.** Or anything else like a relationship. That you sort of half enjoy but don't truly see as meaningful.

## The Solution
Embrace your limits.

1. Accept defeat: you can't get everything done, it's not possible
2. Rediscover wonder: compare the time of being alive to not being alive. Existing itself is an amazing coincidence.
3. Find meaning in finitude. If we had infinite time, ultimately nothing would really matter.

## Action Points
- Practice doing nothing (like [[4 Archive/Notes/Focus-First Lifestyle - Video Script\|Focus-First Lifestyle - Video Script]])
- Rediscover rest
	- Stop seeing free time as time to cram into side hustles and stuff
	- Go for a slow walk
- Pay yourself first
	- Don't put your own stuff at the end of the day
	- Pay with time
- Decide when to fail
	- Know we are going to fail at some things that truly matter to us
	- Do this on purpose
	- Well, but know that everything that *really* needs to happen, will stay happening
	- Other things like cooking: just takeaway
	- Other things like email: be okay not replying
	- Say 'no' to cool stuff
- Limit our work in progress
	- Operate a two-column to-do list: open list and closed list. Closed list can only have 10 things.
- Serialize, serialize, serialize
	- Focus on *one big project* at a time. No parallel stuff.
	- Actually choose the thing that's the highest priority.
