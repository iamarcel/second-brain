tags:: #a/concept 

The practice of being aware of glitches in the Matrix of our world, and using them to "hop" and make moves that would otherwise seem like magic.

It's a brule that there are no shortcuts in life. This is the practice of using these shortcuts and opportunities, of completely thinking outside of the box, using a radically different strategy and winning impossibly fast.

Basically cheat codes for life.

Same as what [[4 Archive/Notes/Tales Alves\|Tales Alves]] calls his Masterplan.
