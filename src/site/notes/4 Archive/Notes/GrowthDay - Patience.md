I think I have been capable of patience because I know I'll keep trying. **I'll show up as my best self over and over, and know that over time the results will take care of themselves.**

I have patience because I model others. I'm following their map so I know it works.

I think a lot of patience comes from humility.

I have patience because I'm constantly iterating from feedback.

I have patience because I'm constantly learning. **That's why journaling is so crucial.** Top athletes journal about what they've learned all the time. "I've tried this and it didn't work."
