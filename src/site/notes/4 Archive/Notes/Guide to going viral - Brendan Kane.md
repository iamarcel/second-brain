Company of this guy: Hook Point.

Content doesn't go viral based on luck, it goes viral based on science.

There are 4 Bln creators and they're all comparing with the attention you want. Also the extremely popular ones.

Create content the algorithm loves and it will push it around.

Formula: grab attention + hold attention + monetize attention. Only attention with substance extracts value.

The algorithm is not build to push you to paying.

**The algorithms only care about user retention.** Thst is the underlying business model of the platform. Your content wins if it stops scrolling and makes users look longer.

Steps
1. Establish a network of viral masterminds 
2. Stay on top of viral trends research
3. Continuously test

**You need to get in a mastermind and go deep into the details of what makes a video go viral.**

It's not just enough to discuss what is currently going viral. To know both what is and what is *not* working.

**Originality does not trump functionality.**

Stay close to the data. Be opportunistic and look at the recent trends.

Do research into the **context** of other successful creators. It's not about the content.
- Editing
- Pacing
- First three seconds

Build hypotheses for both performance drivers and detractors.

Then single iteration production to eliminate hypotheses.

Frequency is not the main driver of success, the key is still this virality.

This model works because it increases the viral quality of what you produce. The research and feedback should be foundational points. Because what goes viral is always changing.

Don't only look at high performers. Look at the lows too. Otherwise you won't know the drivers.

Communication breakdown. How do people connect with brand?
- 30% feelings
- 25% facts
- 20% fun
- 10% value (committed, that you value them)
- 10% imagination
- 5% action

The people creating the content should have aligned their communication style with the customer'sâ€”as a team.

Don't miss out how you're connecting.
