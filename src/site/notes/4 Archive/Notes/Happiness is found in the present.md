# Relax and let your Success Mechanism work for you
Our trouble is that we ignore the automatic Creative Mechanism and **try to solve all our problems by conscious thought**, or forebrain thinking.

If we wish our trains of ideation and volition to be copious and varied and effective, we must form the habit of freeing them from the inhibitive influence of reflection upon them.

Success comes when you give up the struggle consciously, and stop trying to solve your problems by conscious thought.

We are all creative workers.

Skill is not in painfully and consciously thinking out each action, but letting the job do itself through you.

Focus on the journey the majority of the time, and occasionally tune into the goal.

## Five Rules for Freeing Your Creative Machinery
### Do your worrying before you place your bet, not after the wheel starts turning
After we have set the wheels in motion, so to speak, we continually worry over how it would come out.

I have discovered that much nervousness and anxiety is caused by mentally trying to escape or run away from something that you have decided to go through with physically.

### Form the habit of consciously responding to the present moment
By living today well you do the most within your power to make tomorrow better.

The Native Americans and the early pioneers had to be alert to the sights and sounds and feelings of their environment in order to survive. So does modern man, but for a different reason: not because of physical dangers, but because of the dangers of "nervous disorders" that come from confused thinking.

### Try to do only one thing at a time
The jittery feelings are not caused by the work, but by our mental attitude which is "I ought to be able to do this all at once." We become nervous because we are trying to do the impossible.

# Ingredients of the "Success-Type" Personality and How to Acquire Them

## Courage
> "The best defense is a strong offense is a military principle, but its application is wider than war. All problems, personal, national, or combat, become smaller if you don't dodge them but confront them. **Touch a thistle timidly, and it pricks you; grasp it boldly and its spines crumble.**" – Admiral William F. Halsey [[on/courage\|on/courage]]

Any time you act can be wrong. Your automatic guidance system cannot guide you when you're stalled, standing still.

Maybe our urge to gamble comes form an urge to bet on ourselves and take risks.

> "Most people don't know how brave they really are. In fact, many potential heroes, both men and women, live out their lives in self-doubt. If they only knew they had these deep resources, it would give them the self-reliance to meet most problems, even a big crisis."

## Compassion
**Our feelings about ourselves tend to correspond to our feelings about other people.** When someone begins to feel more compassion about others, he invariably begins to feel more compassion toward himself.

If you don't feel important, stop judging others.
To stop feeling guilt, stop condemning other people in your own mind.

Another reason why compassion is symptomatic of the successful personality type is because it means they're dealing with reality: people *are* important.

## Esteem
Self-distesteem, "It's no use, I can't do it," is the deadliest of all the traps and pitfalls in life.

Holding a low opinion of ourselves is not a virtue—it's a vice.

Practice appreciating your worth. Your esteem comes not from what you've done but from what you *are*.

## Self-Confidence
We can just as easily delete negative thoughts from our minds as we can delete documents by dragging them into the trash on our computer screen.

Confidence is built on an experience of success. Our Success Mechanism is engaged when you repeat the commands that work and remember them. Forget the mistakes and errors.

**You don't learn from failure—otherwise you would get worse the more you practice.**

## Self-Acceptance
**Success comes from self-expression.** It eludes people who strive and strain to be somebody—and often comes, almost of its own accord, when a person becomes willing to relax and be himself.

No one ever succeeds during a lifetime in fully expressing or bringing into actuality all the potentialities of the real self. In our actual, expressed self, we never exhaust all the possibilities and powers of the real self. We can always learn more, perform better, behave better. The actual self is necessarily imperfect. Throughout life it is always *moving toward* an ideal goal, but never arriving. The actual self is not a static but a dynamic thing. It is never completed and final, but always in a state of growth.

# How to Unlock Your Real Personality
Your real self is already in you, to be *released*.
The real self is attractive, magnetic, and can powerfully influence other people.
This is why people love a baby or a cat.

The enemy is the *inhibited personality*, which thinks too much before expressing itself.

Characteristics of inhibited personality:
- Frustration
- Stuttering
- Seeing oneself as not enough

Source: excessive negative feedback. Normal negative feedback is good and taken as corrective action, not stopping the action.

Self-expression may become morally "wrong" as far as your conscience is concerned, if you were squelched, shut-up, shamed, humiliated, or perhaps punished as a child for speaking up, expressing your ideas, "showing off."

**Purpose tremor**: how we start trembling when precision in movement becomes very important and we overly focus on it.

Solutions:
- Relaxation
- Reducing attachment to outcome
- Imagine you're in a relaxing environment (positive memory)
- Practice being less careful
- Speak before you think
- Act without thinking
- Let people know when you like them

Yes, we need some amount of inhibition, but if you have too much you need to practice reducing it.

Example in teaching: prepare yourself in the subject so well that it shall always be on tap; then in the classroom trust your spontaneity and fling away all further care.

Never "try" to make a good first impression.

You're not "self-conscious," you're too conscious of *others*.

The yardstick of emotions is not if they're good or bad, but if they're appropriate or inappropriate.

From the moment of birth you were immersed in action. You cannot think before you act, you can only go and course-correct.

# Do-It-Yourself Tranquilizers That Bring Peace of Mind
Our feelings do not depend on externals, but on our own attitudes, reactions, and responses.

## Over-Response
We often respond overly, like getting stressed once the phone rings, making us pick it up immediately.

Practice relaxation by not responding and relaxing in that. Visualize this practice: sit down, imagine the phone is ringing and not reacting to it. Visualize going calmly and effortlessly to the daily tasks.

If you cannot ignore the response, delay it.

## Physical Relaxation
You cannot feel angry, fearful, anxious, insecure, unsafe as long as you muscles remain perfectly relaxed.

## Build a Quiet Room
Create a clean, quiet room in your mind. Close your eyes and walk up to this room. Enter it, and see it with vivid detail. It should be simple.

I have a big wall of books and a fireplace. A chair in front of it. A big window overlooking a valley. Some birds in the background, the crackling of the fire, the smell of wood.

> "I have a foxhole in my mind." – President Harry Truman

Visit this decompression chamber between activities.

> "Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break, but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it." – Marcus Aurelius

Man is not primarily a "reactor" but an "actor"

## Stabilize
In almost any goal-striving situation, our own inner stability is in itself an important goal to maintain.

# How to Turn a Crisis into a Creative Opportunity
Some people react well in a crisis and rise up to the challenge, others fail when they're under pressure. How do you do the former?

## Practice without Pressure
Under pressure we learn fast, but not well. What we learn gets stuck and it's harder to unlearn.

[[Cognitive Map\|Cognitive Map]]: your mind, as it learns, builds a map of the concept. If it's over-motivated, the map becomes narrow instead of wide, and you learn to only follow the set plan that got you out of the crisis the first time.

[[Shadowboxing\|Shadowboxing]]: practicing the moves before you're under pressure, builds myelin and makes you used to the action. Then, when faced with a stressful situation, you'll handle it well.

Slowly build up to avoid stress tremor. Practice the moves without any pressure to achieve first, then slowly add them in.

Baseball: let the bat come around and meet the ball.

## Crisis Brings Power
React to moments of crisis aggressively.

Only if we fearlessly accept the challenge and confidently expand our strength, every danger or difficulty brings its own strength.

[[Prescott Lecky\|Prescott Lecky]] believed there was only one basic emotion, "excitement," and that it manifests itself as fear, anger, courage, etc., depending on our own inner goals at the time.

## What Is the Worst That Can Possibly Happen?
To calm yourself down, do [[Fear-setting\|Fear-setting]].

Mountain climbing over molehills.

# How to Get That Winning Feeling
Once you give your automatic Creative Mechanism a definite goal to achieve, you can depend on its automatic guidance system to take you to that goal much better than you could ever could by conscious thought.

Think of the end result in terms of a present possibility.

If we dwell upon failure, and continually picture failure to ourselves in such vivid detail that it becomes *real* to our nervous system, we will experience the feelings that go with failure.

The winning feeling does not cause you to operate successfully, but is more in the nature of a sign or symptom that you are geared for success.

**Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you're retired.** (Page 78)

I think the smartest people can explain things to a child. (Page 95)

It's actually really important to have empty space. If you don't have a day or two every week in your calendar where you're not always in meetings, and you're not always busy, then you're not going to be able to think.

You're not going to be able to have good ideas for your business. You're not going to be able to make good judgments. I also encourage taking at least one day a week (preferably two, because if you budget two, you'll end up with one) where you just have time to think.

It's only after you're bored you have the great ideas. It's never going to be when you're stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. (Page 98)

Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are. (Page 101)

> I never ask if I like it" or "I don't like it." I think "this is what it is" or "this is what it isn't."
> - Richard Feynman (Page 104)


**The way to get out of the competition trap is to be authentic**, to find the thing you know how to do better than anybody.

You know how to do it better because you love it, and no one can compete with you. If you love to do it, be authentic, and then figure out how to map that to what society actually wants.

Apply some leverage and put your name on it. You take the risks, but you gain the rewards, have ownership and equity in what you're doing, and just crank it up.


I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money.


I'm "always working." It looks like work to others, **but it feels like play to me. And that's how I know no one can compete with me on it.** Because I'm just playing, for sixteen hours a day. If others want to compete with me, they're going to work, and they're going to lose because they're not going to do it for sixteen hours a day, seven days a week.


If you want to make the maximum amount of money possible, if you want to get rich over your life in a deterministically predictable way, stay on the bleeding edge of trends and study technology, design, and art-become really good at something.


Without hard work, you'll develop neither judgment nor leverage.

You have to put in the time, but the judgment is more important. **The direction you're heading in matters more than how fast you move**, especially with leverage. Picking the direction you're heading in for every decision is far, far more important than how much force you apply. Just pick the right direction to start walking in, and start walking.

The more you know, the less you diversify. (Page 106)

I think a lot of modern society can be explained through evolution, One theory is civilization exists to answer the question of who gets to mate. If you look around, from a purely sexual selection perspective, sperm is abundant and eggs are scarce.

It's an allocation problem.

Literally all of the works of mankind and womankind can be traced down to people trying to solve this problem. (Page 107)


Microeconomics and game theory are fundamental. I don't think you can be successful in business or even navigate most of our modern capitalist society without an extremely good understanding of supply-and-demand, labor-versus-capital, game theory, and those kinds of things.


I just don't believe in anything from my past. Anything. No memories. No regrets. No people. No trips. Nothing. A lot of our unhappiness comes from comparing things from the past to the present. (Page 134)


A happy person isn't someone who is happy all the time. It's someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lose their innate peace. (Page 136)


Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. (Page 138)

A calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love.

These things cannot be bought.
They must be earned.


The three big ones in love are wealth, health, and happiness.

We pursue them in that order, but their importance is reverse.


**Don't take yourself too seriously. You're just a monkey with a plan.**


To me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It's not about negative thoughts. It's about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving, because the mind really exists in motion toward the future or the past. The more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. If I latch onto a feeling, if I say "oh, I'm happy now" and I want to stay happy, then I'm going to drop out of that happiness. Now, suddenly, the mind is moving. It's trying to attach to something. It's trying to create a permanent situation out of a temporary situation. ^556d05

Real happiness comes as a side effect of peace.

The advantage of meditation is recognizing just how out of control your kind is. It is like a monkey flinging feces, running around the room, making trouble, shouting, and breaking things. It's completely uncontrollable. (Page 175)


The real truths are heresies. They cannot be spoken. Only discovered, whispered, and perhaps read.

Today: become wildly successful beyond your dreams; and do it with the serenity of a Zen monk.

The concepts here that will help us grow spiritually also will help us grow in the material world.

It does not work if you try to do it transactionally. It doesn't work even as a secondary goal.

It only works when you're on the spiritual path, and let the material success happen organically as a byproduct.

Most people think success = work harder, manage time better, etc… The truth is that success is about *thinking* differently.

We fail to *consistently* think differently because we try to think differently.

Right now there's something in your life that you really want and it's causing turmoil in your life. **Would you rather get what you want or outgrow your need for it?**

You don't want a 100 million company—you want the feeling you would get if you were running that. Actually, **it's the feeling you *think you will have***.

You feel a deep lacking. You feel a need to have, get or create something in order to feel happy.

You cannot solve an internal lack with external action.

### Happiness
What do you need to *get* in order to be happy?

**Our life is a quest for happiness by acquisition. And it's wrong.**

### The if-then [[Mental Model\|Mental Model]]
> I have to get x so I can do y and then be z.

No matter how often we're to this is wrong, we keep trying to fix it by changing the if part of the model.

We quite literally use this to make ourselves unhappy.

There's nothing you need to do to be happy. In fact it's very hard to be unhappy. ^36702a

The if-then model is broken.

That times you were suddenly in awe and happy seeing a beautiful scenery, that was because you accepted the universe exactly as it was.

Your life with all the problems you have and think you have, is just as perfect.

Acceptance doesn't mean you roll over and do nothing. You try to make them how you want them to be; if I succeed, fantastic, if not, fantastic. I severed the if-then link.

### Goals
Set goals. Tru your level best to achieve them. **If you succeed, great, if you fail, great.**

**The benefit of setting a goal and trying is the learning and growth** we have in us as we try our level best to achieve it.

If you succeed the growth is in you, if you failed the growth is not fully embodied yet. Once you stop failing at a goal, you've embodied the learning.

Would I rather be pushed by great pain or pulled by grand vision? (Both work)

Act from a place of being okay, always having been okay and knowing you always will be okay.

Of you did your very best, you will like the outcome.

The more you enjoy the process, the more likely you will get the outcome you want, paradoxically.

### Mental Chatter
It's always there like an unwanted relative that walked into your life.

Your mental chatter determines your life.

**You don't live in the real world. You build the world you live in with your mental chatter and mental models.**

The second arrow is always delivered by mental chatter.

> Exercise
> Think of current problem and how mental chatter jas been holding you back here.

I cannot overstate how significant mental chatter is in leading your life.

The reason you procrastinate is mental chatter.

### Stress
There is only one reason you have stress in your life: because you have a rigid idea of how the universe should be, the universe doesn't listen to your preferences, and in that friction you feel stress.

You have stress because you think you shouldn't have financial issues.

### Control ([[Mental Model\|Mental Model]])
Every single one of you is a control freak.

**You have spent your entire life trying to control some part of your internal or external environment.** You're a blinking control freak.

You don't have control.
You never had control.
You never will have control.

Control is an illusion.

This illusion of control is fantastic, it gets you out of bed and making plans and setting and achieving goals.

“I have influence” is like saying “she's a little bit pregnant.” The feeling of control is fantastic because it makes you do things, but do it knowing it's an illusion.

Invest in the process, not in the outcome. Growing, learning, paradoxically achieving.

### Resilience 
Good thing, bad thing, who knows?

The thing in your life that you're about to label “bad,” could it in a few years turn out to become a good thing?

Is there anything I can proactively do to make this a better thing?

**Extreme resiliency is where you bounce back so fast that an external observer doesn't register that you had a bad thing happen.**

Suffering starts when you label something as such.

### The universe is friendly
When it's a battle between you and the universe, always bet on the universe.

Einstein: the most important question you can ask yourself is, is the universe friendly?

What if the universe was not indifferent? What if the universe knew you existed, and in fact is well-intentioned towards you? What if it didn't give you what you wanted, but exactly what you need?

**Regardless or whether or not the universe is friendly, believing that it is friendly will greatly amplify your experience of life.**

If you want to believe the universe is friendly, look for reasons that show it is.

You can keep a journal of this if you want. Make a list of ways the universe is showing it knows you exist. Review it from time to time.

Mantra to deal with the world:

**Constant gentle pressure.**

You need the company of the wise to stay grounded.

I'll say some outlandish things. Don't push it away. Think about it and think about it some more. Use your own life experience to gauge what I say.

Only one way out of the asking “who made it out if what”: God made the universe out of itself.

### Dreams
Discarding dreams is a grave mistake. That's a third of your life you throw away; don't be the scientist that throws away so much data. It's a part of you.

**The entire universe lives in your mind. You've got it completely backwards.** The universe is not real.

If you say, what is real is what is always there—your day life is not real and your dream self is not real.

The thing that is always there is your awareness that you exist. That is the only reality, it's the only thing that's real.

We identify with a particular body-mind complex and then say, this is real. That is the root cause of your suffering because that is what brings in difference. This is me and me gotta win!!1!

When you leave only awareness as real, there is only one. Because there is only one awareness for everyone. It's a single one.

If you look at any single part of me, I am energy, I move at the speed of light and I'm the same age as the universe.

Think about something you're going to do tomorrow. You just crested an alternative universe in your mind.

Thought is so integrated that it is completely compulsory for humans het we're the only species that have it.

Our identity is beyond our ability to perceive het it is always there. Maybe I'm not a ham being with consciousness but a part of consciousness shaped like a human. Just like the waves are not separate, they're the ocean.

I am that cosmic energy, like I've always been.

All suffering is based on the idea that there is a separate me as human being. But in reality death is not something that happens to me, because I stay being energy as I always was.

**Enlightenment engineering**.

Your intellectual understanding is not your lived experience.

You can enjoy all that is happening if you identify as the screen everything is playing on.

Look at your own mental chatter and realize it is always pointed outwards.

Meditation will not instantly fix tens of hears of mental chatter conditioning.

Pray without seizing. Book: [[The Way of the Pilgrim\|The Way of the Pilgrim]].

Keep in your stream of consciousness just: “I am.” You can look at yourself in the third person.

The more attention you pay to mental chatter, the more it loses energy.

The problem is not mental chatter, the problem is that you identify with mental chatter.

It is entirely possible to get to the state where things are happening and it's not you who is doing it. Not just brushing your teeth but also at work.

You are just an instrument of the universe.

In this need to understand you implicitly create this duality between yourself and others.

There comes a time where you have to stop thinking. You can't effort yourself into that.

It takes constant, continuous effort to tone down mental chatter. It only takes days or weeks to start noticing the benefits. But to truly way to get to the quiet mind takes years, decades, lifetimes.

I'm giving you tools to get out of the illusion but as long as you stay in it, might as well enjoy it.

There is no space and time, there is only spacetime.

Maybe Elon Musk doesn't win because he gets up at 3AM and balances on one finger, but just because the universe wanted it so.

There is no striving, it simply unfolds.

Surrender is not something you do willingly, it is something that happens.

Inshallah: if it is the will of Allah
