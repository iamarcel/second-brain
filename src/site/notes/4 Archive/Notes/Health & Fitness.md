# Why?
Two main drivers:
- Energy
- Beauty

First and most importantly, I want to be alive and energetic every day. I only want to be tired when the day has ended. There's a ton of things I want to do every day and I pay a lot of attention to making sure I can so it as well as possible.

With more energy comes:
- More work done (in less time)
- Better emotional regulation (I don't get angry or frustrated or feel down)
- Remembering more good habits
- Feeling better

Increasing my energy is my first go-to that kickstarts the "upwards spiral" of feeling good and better every day.

Secondly, I want to *look good*. I don't care how "selfish" that goal might be. I want to be fucking sexy. I want to look into the mirror and be proud when I'm naked, I want to be looked at and complimented by girls when they see me shirtless. Just like I value beauty in my interior, I value myself to be beautiful too.

# Premise

My health is the most important thing in my life.

I am in complete control over my health and fitness, and I step into that responsibility with joyful dedication and discipline.

My body is a healing _******machine******_. When I nourish and train it, it will give back superb health and infinite stamina.

# Vision

I am an athlete.

I can express the full range of human capacity at a high level—running, lifting heavy things, throwing, swimming. I can play and move for hours without being exhausted, with my lover, my children, my friends. I can run impromptu sprints, do impromptu dances, and protect when there are impromptu dangers.

I’m not just strong and sexy, but I have boundless energy because I train my stamina.

I am big yet lean, around 12% body fat but heavier than 80kg. I love to hold my smaller spouse and she feels incredibly safe when held by my strong, big and boundless-energy mass.

I will live like this, full of strength and stamina, for the rest of my long life. I will be at least 120 years old and do it all in amazing health.

I don’t get sick. Even when sickness comes up I nourish my body even more and it heals me easily.

I show my athleticism to myself all the time: I take the stairs instead of the escalators, I stretch deeply, I help people lift things, I run with children.

# Purpose

Without health and fitness I’ll just sit there. Laughing to appear happy but tired inside. Heavy in my belly. Slow. Tired after taking the stairs. Not willing or excited to move. I’ll have to stay behind when I see others enjoy and have fun. Pondering why I’m not fully alive and happy—not realizing that it’s _just my physical body that wants to be used_.

But I have big plans. I have big ambitions. And there’s no way I’ll get there without an abundance of strength, power, vitality, and stamina.

I want to challenge myself, continuously, and this is where I will do that most consistently.

Pushing myself in the gym proves that I have the perseverance to push myself in all other areas: business, love, protecting my spirit and energy.

Because I’m a winner and winning my own body is the first, daily, minute-by-minute win.

I’m not here for average—I’m here for ULTRA. My body has to *look the part*.

I want to be the best, for myself, the people around me and the rest of the world.

This is *necessary* for an abundant, exciting, passionate, intense sex life. It’s necessary for my bravery. It’s necessary to feel sexy. I want to be proud when I look in the mirror, every day of my life, because I know I can do whatever I want.

# Strategy

- Go resistance training 3x per week
    - Find a gym whenever I travel for more than a week
    - Full body hypertrophy-adjusted Stronglifts program
- Go running 1x per week
- Try to get 2g/kg protein and 3-5g/kg carbs per day (more on the 5g probably)
	- Protein: `76kg * 2g/kg * 4kcal/g = 608kcal`
	- Carbs: `76kg * 5g/kg * 4kcal/g = 1520kcal`
	- Fat: `120g * 9kcal/g = 1080kcal`
	- That's a bit over 3000kcal, think that's good for bulking for me
- Do what I can to minimize my estrogen levels
	- No plastic food containers (esp. heated) & clothing
	- No soy
    
- Tweet about testosterone optimization
    
    For 40 year old men, the average testosterone level is 427.
    
    I went from facing testicular cancer to naturally doubling my testosterone levels to 871.
    
    Here’re 29 pieces of testosterone boosting advice I’d give my older self (bookmark this):
    
    1. Supplements won't save you.
        
    2. Calorie counting is a scam.
        
    3. Fasting is ridiculously overrated.
        
    4. Focus on nutrient density over everything else.
        
    5. Your light environment is as important as your nutrition.
        
    6. Eat at least 5 eggs within 90 minutes of waking.
        
    7. Salt, honey, and methylene blue before exercise is 10x healthier than any pre-workout.
        
    8. The most powerful supplement combination is magnesium chloride and thiamine in sparkling water.
        
    9. The original steroids are oysters and liver.
        
    10. The most essential vitamins for testosterone optimization are A, D, K2, E, choline, B1, B3, zinc, and copper (all sourced from animal foods).
        
    11. Don't fear carbs. Gorge on seasonal fruit.
        
    12. When you work out, pull more than you push.
        
    13. Train legs at least once a week. Front squats, reverse lunges, walking lunges or hex bar deadlifts are a superb starting point.
        
    14. AG1, Tongkat, Fedogia, Tribulus, and nearly all herbs and powders are a scam.
        
    15. Quality sleep is critical. Red lights, hard mattress, window ajar, topical magnesium chloride, inositol, and mouth tape will transform your rest.
        
    16. Prioritize animal protein or seafood every meal.
        
    17. Focus on fruits, raw honey, and maple syrup if you want to lose weight; and rice, sourdough, and potatoes if you want to gain weight.
        
    18. Plant protein powders are toxic. The best is goats or sheep whey.
        
    19. Normalize having at least 30g of gelatin a day.
        
    20. A f*cked gut or liver will destroy testosterone levels. Consider using Quiksilver Scientific's "Push-Catch" detox system for 1 month to restore functionality.
        
    21. Never underestimate the importance of good thyroid health. If your resting heart rate is below 60 bpm and your basal temperature is below 97.7, this could be silently sabotaging your T levels.
        
    22. The secret to protecting high T is training less but more intense. Check out the "Rest-Pause" method.
        
    23. Correct your posture with T3 raises, Neck extensions, Powell raises, Face Pulls, Swiss Ball Glute Bridges, Back Extension Isometric Holds, All cable or dumbbell row variations, and Chin-up variations.
        
    24. Avoid tap water like the plague. Drink exclusively mineralized reverse osmosis water or glass bottled sparkling water with added magnesium chloride, Vera salt, and B1/Thiamine.
        
    25. Don't tug your wand. Retain your semen.
        
    26. Get natural light in the eyes upon waking and before the sun sets.
        
    27. Sauna regularly.
        
    28. Sprint at least once per week.
        
    29. When you lift, it's better to be slow and intentional. Focus on good form and proper breathing hygiene.
        
    
    Bonus:
    
    30. Don't be afraid of the odd cigar and glass of Bordeaux.
    
    Take every piece of advice here with a grain of salt.
    
    This is what I learned on my own journey, so it might not translate 100% for you.
