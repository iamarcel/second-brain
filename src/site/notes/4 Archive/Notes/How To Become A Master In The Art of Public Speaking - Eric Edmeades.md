Every inch of height increases you salary a little bit, on average.

If you can speak well, articulate your ideas, being influential in how you communicate, can *triple or more your income*. It's the most influential thing you can do in your career.

Not a single one of us was born afraid.

One of the best ways to manifest everything you want in life is to **celebrate saying 'no' to cool stuff**. Imagine Richard Branson—he can do anything with anyone, anytime. So he must have to say 'no' to 9000 cool things a day.

If you have FOMO your body will do anything to avoid that pain, including holding you back from creating these opportunities in the first place.

Reframe: No! How cool is it that I have to say no to that!

Don't ever show the audience you're nervous.

If you've ever given a great talk, got complimented, and were still nervous the next time: **it's because you showed them you're nervous and so you didn't believe their words**. You thought they were platitudes and lies, because you admitted you're nervous which made it easier for them to give compliments, but it's like cocaine—it just ends.
