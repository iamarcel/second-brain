# Article Notes
Build something so good and so specific it stands alone.

There is no one like you. That means no one can compete with you if you stand out and showcase who you are.

The main point of a [[Company of One\|Company of One]] is that bigger is not necessarily better.
The main point of a [[0 Inbox/Niche of One\|Niche of One]] is that narrowing down is not always better.

Multipotentiality is the curiosity or preference to follow different passions. The artistic or intellectual ability to excel in two or more different fields. ^05d43a

> A multipotentialite is a person who has many different interests and creative pursuits in life.
> 
> Multipotentialites have no “one true calling” the way specialists do. Being a multipotentialite is our destiny. We have many paths and we pursue all of them, either sequentially or simultaneously (or both).
> 
> Multipotentialites thrive on learning, exploring, and mastering new skills. We are excellent at bringing disparate ideas together in creative ways. This makes us incredible innovators and problem solvers.
> 
> When it comes to new interests that emerge, our insatiable curiosity leads us to absorb everything we can get our hands on. As a result, we pick up new skills fast and tend to be a wealth of information.

you are a completely unique individual who has the complete capability of using the level-playing field of the Internet to grow your career and your earning potential

Much of the issue for multi-passionate, multi-hyphenated, jack of all trades, polymathic generalists is that after picking a niche, they will outgrow it. They feel the need to challenge themselves once again, satiate their curiosity, and stimulate their creative, contextual, and connected brains.

Many creatives who dabble in many disciplines secretly dream of a job where they can be paid to be their natural selves. If they could avoid doing things for a prolonged period of time they would because once they quickly understand it, they need to move on to something else. Their authentic nature is of a strategic mind and of a big-picture thinker. So they search on and on for new roles that will give them the level of freedom to be themselves not only in their style of work but with their fluid personalities. They despise feeling trapped in a box because they know identities are social constructs. And it can be damaging for personalities high in Openness. **Building a niche of one is equivalent to creating your own dream job. Your focus becomes on building your brand as a vehicle of sharing what you love with others.**

**Your entire success as a creator is to find idea market fit. You are looking to explain and develop your ideas in creative form as fast and as uniquely as possible.**

Let your persona shine. **Humans are drawn to people.** ^5d50db

Differentiate yourself even more by choosing your aesthetics _right now_ that would naturally fit your personality, vibe, and the best way your ideas will be received by your audience. Aesthetics are power in being recognized and remembered before you offer anything.

[[The Art of Purpose\|The Art of Purpose]] success story: By studying and collecting what they did that worked, he replicated their success and attained 25,000 followers in less than six months.

You find your niche of one by being in an active mode of reflection and experimentation. You can only do this by creating content and sharing it online in many formats. Refinement comes as you go along.

For aspiring creators taking a holistic approach — **_Ikigai_**  
For seasoned creators who want to step up their game — **_Specific Knowledge_**  
For creators who want a unique way to define what they do — **_Hybrid Professional Identity_**  
For thought creators searching to find their edge — _**Personal Philosophy**_

But if you build your niche of one in public, they’ll stay wondering what you’ll say about other things. You become their hidden gem.

Commit to being exceptional at what you do. You do not have to be the best, you do not have to be perfect, but you must be world-class. And world-class is evaluated by giving what you do a 5-star rating. Define what 5-stars is to you.

Be the tortoise *and* the hare.

And if you’re unable to define what any of the intersections are, don’t worry. Keep dabbling. It’s a sign that your hybridity is still emerging, and your niche of one will develop with it in time.

To be able to build your niche of one fast into a personal monopoly, you must become a prolific content creator. You must come up with a system that is holistic to you. Managing your energy is the most important part of being abundant with ideas and executing them. So maintaining the systems and routines that will help you thrive are the most important to build sustainably and efficiently.

Focus on attaining content market fit by testing many formats until you find your signature style.

It’s better to start off not doing so well so you can shape what you make along the way, and you have the chance to understand why it’s working well.

People who don’t want you to take risks are just worried you’ll fall apart and they’ll have to deal with the negative consequences of that.

The internal path is a path of knowing yourself and the love of knowing who you are. There is a deep empathy that results in taking this journey.

many times the best way to lean into your niche of one is looking at your pain

Your pain is not only a great indicator of what you can use your internal reserves of energy towards to solve, but it’s also the exact thing that you can help contribute to the world by sharing your solution.

what you feel is temporary. What you create out of it, is forever.
