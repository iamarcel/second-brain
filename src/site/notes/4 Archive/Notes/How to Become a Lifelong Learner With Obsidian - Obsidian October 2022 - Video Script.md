	- Sensemaking: Our sense of truth comes from how well the puzzle pieces fit together with the rest of our mental model of reality
	- The fluidity of this model:
		- Placeholders
		- Structure, Features, Purpose can be changed
		- Work on things over a long period

	- [[3 Resources/Highlights/The Perspective Era\|The Perspective Era]]: what people value is a way of looking at things. Of making sense of them. Of the way you combine and interpret a collection of information sources. That's what I did here.
	- Teaching experience: different people need a different way of explaining the same thing to make it "click." Because it needs to fit in *their* knowledge landscape for the sense-making to work. It needs to be able to attach to enough other parts of it.
	- Put your output in your notes too, like this one
	- Obsidian Publish examples:
