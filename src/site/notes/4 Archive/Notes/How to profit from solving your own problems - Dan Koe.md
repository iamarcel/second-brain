The “job first, then happiness” advice may turn people away from well-intentioned pursuits toward a better life.

**With the power of the internet, some marketing knowledge, and the ability to write an attractive message, you can monetize almost anything.**

Problems aren’t personal, they are systemic.

You find your purpose by solving systemic problems, allowing nature to flow as it was meant to.
- What is the big problem you want to solve in the world?
- What is the big problem you want to solve in your life?
With experience, you’ll realize that the answer to these questions are one in the same.

*The Pull* attracts you to your core, your deepest purpose. Living on your edge and leaning into that will let you peel back the layers of lesser purpose around it.

By working your way up to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, you reveal the way inward toward your deepest purpose.

**Adopt a writing habit.**

Writing is what you need to dive into the depths of discovering your purpose. It also creates a strong message.

Writing is how you execute on ideas as fast as possible so they don’t get lost in the depths of your mind.

Media is the front end of the internet.

Only the curious will survive.

People are gaining trust in: independent sources, value-driven communities, clarity and human connection.

The future belongs to the authentic.

Authenticity stems from living through the energy generated from your purpose.

Finding purpose stems from solving your own problems.

**Starting a business is not optional for those who want more out of life.**

When you are surrounded by people that limit your perception of money (i.e., have a finite, salaried income) it will be hard to believe when you hear big numbers.

All that business is, is problem solving. Money is the result of value exchange. Offer to solve someone’s problems for money in areas you know best.

### The Experience Model
Choose a few curiousities that have the potential to solve your own problems.
This is your niche.
Treat your social media accounts as a place for sharing discoveries and talking about your interests *in a persuative way*.

Human connection cannot scale.

Join the C2C (creator-to-creator) economy.

Flow with the current that few can see without being in the space.

Block out all advice you hear about building an online brand until you execute on this and figure it out for yourself: treat Twitter as a public journal.

**Give your current and past selves advice in public.**

It is an increcibly difficult journey. You will have many mental battles. Write your way through them.
