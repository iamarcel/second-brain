# Loving with the heart of the buddha

Western world: we live in a comfort culture. Makes us feel like we're not allowed to feel boredom or sadness in any moment.

Our generation is lost in thought. We have no presence. It's something beautiful only exists in our generation but also has a negative side.

**The best way to bring mindfulness in our life is love.**

Presence *everywhere*. The good feeling and the bad feeling.

Story of Ponte Vecchio. We won't destroy the bridge if you don't use it.

Even **micromoments of love** create a physiological effect. Moments of human flourishing.

## practices
We need to remember to remember

### See the inner nobility and beauty of all human beings
Story of Buddha story, gold covered with clay, people forgot it.

Do it for yourself too.

We cannot bring the love outside if we don't have it within.

Practice: meditate on a moment where you showed greatness, nobility. Take a minute and write things that speak to your own greatness.

- I beam joy when I make eye contact
- I help with love and team spirit 

### Seeing with kindly eyes
It heals people when you see their beauty. When you see potential or the depth of what one is.

Exercise: looking into someone's eyes, hold hands, and completing the sentence “I see that you are…”

**You can see so much in the eyes of strangers. Walk around the world with that energy.**

### Metta
These practices are beautiful when things are good. They're indispensable when things are bad.

The point of spiritual practice is not to perfect ourselves. It is to perfect our love.
