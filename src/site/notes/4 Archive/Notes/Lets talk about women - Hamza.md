Rules for great relationships:
- Only have sex with women you like [[3 Resources/Sex\|Sex]]
- Take actual relationships *seriously* [[3 Resources/Relationships\|Relationships]] 
- Polarize towards more masculine and more feminine, learn to understand sexual energies [[3 Resources/Masculinity\|Masculinity]] [[on/femininity\|on/femininity]]

Book higly recommended, I haven’t given any other book more than this one. I’ve read it twice together with a girlfriend and in both cases at **some moment saw her *click*, where she seemed to understand her femininity and could fully stand into it**. There was so much more flavor to our relationships from that instant on. [[4 Archive/Notes/The Way of the Superior Man\|The Way of the Superior Man]]

That’s the main problem with feminism: it glorifies masculinity in women. It depolarizes, makes women more masculine and men more feminine. It makes our interations bland, boring. We don’t *want* to be the best friends of our lovers, we want them to be our lover. We don’t *want* to never argue, we want to be different and add to each other’s lives.

The masculine energy is about building towards meaningful goals. Always chasing the next step. When he’s having sex it’s like letting go of all of that constraint. [[3 Resources/Masculinity\|Masculinity]] [[3 Resources/Purpose\|Purpose]] 

The feminine energy is flowy and loving and enjoying life. [[on/femininity\|on/femininity]] 

Yeah, the people who are going to be are going to be the big, strong, achieving males. It’s always gonna be the alphas, always the males. Strong masculine men are always going to be looked up to. But that’s only the like 0.00001%—we can debate over whether that makes our society a patriarchy.
