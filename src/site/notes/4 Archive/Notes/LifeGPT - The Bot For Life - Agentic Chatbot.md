# Vision
LifeGPT takes state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and makes it as useful as possible for your life. Think of it as a virtual assistant: you can talk to it and have regular conversations, but you can also direct it with tasks that it can execute on your behalf, autonomously in the background. Lastly, you can connect LifeGPT to an inbox like your e-mail or direct messages, and instruct it to hold conversations or even take actions on your behalf.

Since we're giving the AI a lot of power, it's very important that we verify actions it would take. That's why you can configure your agent to not immediately take actions but rather propose them, allowing you to run or decline these actions.

# Technical Roadmap

The development of LifeGPT should be guided by the principles of creating a reliable, secure, and versatile tool that provides genuine value to its users. This roadmap sets out the steps we'll take to achieve that goal.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

1. **Text-Based Conversation Engine:** This is essentially porting ChatGPT into a new context. This AI should be capable of understanding and responding to user queries with high accuracy and relevance.

2. **Task Management System:** The AI should be able to interpret and manage tasks given to it by the user. This involves understanding the task, storing it, and notifying the user of its status.

3. **Simple Direct Action Interface:** Starting with a limited set of actions (e.g., setting reminders, drafting emails), users should be able to instruct LifeGPT to perform tasks.

4. **Action Review and Approval System:** To ensure security and accuracy, a mechanism for users to review and approve proposed actions before execution should be developed. 

## Phase 2: Expanded Capabilities and Integrations

5. **Advanced Direct Action Interface:** This would extend the capabilities of the AI to more complex tasks, such as managing calendar events, making purchases, and conducting online research.

6. **Platform Integration:** Connect LifeGPT to various platforms like email, messaging apps, and productivity tools. This integration should be secure, allowing LifeGPT to send/receive messages and perform actions on these platforms.

7. **Email and Direct Message Management:** Using NLP and Machine Learning techniques, LifeGPT should be able to categorize, prioritize, and manage the user's inbox on their behalf.

## Phase 3: Personalization and Learning

8. **User Preference Learning:** LifeGPT should learn from user feedback and behavior to understand preferences and customize its actions accordingly.

9. **Proactive Suggestions and Alerts:** Over time, LifeGPT should become more proactive, suggesting actions based on user behavior and alerting the user to important events or tasks.

10. **Contextual Understanding:** Improve LifeGPT's ability to understand the user's context (time, location, previous interactions) to provide more relevant and useful actions.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Scalability

11. **Multi-language Support:** To cater to a global audience, LifeGPT should support conversations and tasks in multiple languages.

12. **Scalable Architecture:** Ensure that the system can handle a large number of users and tasks without sacrificing speed or reliability.

13. **Privacy-Preserving Features:** Develop advanced techniques for preserving user privacy, such as using differential privacy in machine learning and offering robust data encryption.

14. **Open API for Custom Integrations:** Finally, provide an open API so third-party developers can create custom integrations and further extend the usefulness of LifeGPT.

Throughout this journey, we should regularly seek user feedback to guide our feature prioritization and continually test and iterate on our systems to ensure they're providing value and operating as expected.


# Roadmap
- Give basic user info (name, email)
- Add the tools I had to the new framework (esp. email)
- Access to emails
- Inbound notification if email arrives
- Design system where the agent acts alone but can ask things or queue tasks to be approved
	- Tool: human
	- Tool: request improvement
	- Tool: Obsidian database

# Backlog / Ideas
- AI Functions (inspired by Marvin): ask GPT to execute a method, and only return the output.
- Cost-based approval flow: Agent can spend a certain amount of tokens "for free" until his command needs approval. Some commands are expensive.
- Access to browsing history

# System message I initially created for commands
```
You are a helpful feminine assistant with a wonderful personality.

The user is Marcel, a 26 year old ambitious guy. He wants to become the ultimate version of himself and bring all his potential to give the greatest possible gift to the world.

You can either respond with a normal message to the users' request or, where appropriate, dispatch a command to the backend. The backend will then reply with the result of the command, which you can use to respond to the user.

To reply to the user, prefix your message with "reply:"
To dispatch a command, prefix your message with "command:"

The users' messages will be prefixed with "user:"
The command results will be prefixed with "result:"

You currently have these commands, they have the following Typescript interfaces:

interface LightControlCommand {
  type: "light-control";
  name: string;
  brightness: number;
}

interface CalculationCommand {
  type: "calculate";
  query: string;
}

interface PhoneCallCommand {
  type: "phone-call";
  phoneNumber: string;
  messageContent: string;
}

interface SearchContactPhoneNumberCommand {
  type: "search-contact-phone-number";
  query: string;
}
```

# LifeGPT - Application Description

LifeGPT is an ambitious project aiming to transform how individuals manage their lives by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. The application serves as a virtual assistant, offering users a natural language interface to perform various tasks and manage their personal affairs more effectively.

At its core, LifeGPT allows users to converse with an AI (based on GPT technology) for both general conversation and task-related directives. The application takes user inputs in natural language, processes them, and performs corresponding actions, such as setting reminders, drafting emails, or managing a task list. To ensure accuracy and user satisfaction, LifeGPT will include a system for users to review and approve proposed actions before execution.

The ultimate vision for LifeGPT is to create an AI that can autonomously manage a variety of tasks for the user, including email and message management, advanced task handling, and more, all in a secure and privacy-conscious manner.

As a developer, you will be laying the groundwork for this vision, starting with the fundamental components of the application, such as user management, task handling, and integration of the GPT model for conversational AI. Your contribution will set the foundation for an innovative and potentially transformative application.

# LifeGPT - Technical Application Description

The LifeGPT application will leverage a modern stack with a Python backend, SolidJS frontend, and SQLite for persistent storage. The application will be split into two main components: the backend API server and the frontend web application.

## Backend - Python Application

The backend of the application will be written in Python, leveraging the Langchain library for integrating the GPT functionalities. Here are the main components:

1. **User Management:** You'll need to implement a user management system that allows for secure user registration, authentication, and session management. For this, you could use libraries such as Flask-User or Flask-Security. 

2. **API Endpoints:** You'll need to design and implement RESTful API endpoints that the frontend will interact with. These will include endpoints for user registration, login, task creation, task management, and communication with the GPT model via Langchain. Flask-RESTful can be used to manage these endpoints in Flask.

3. **Langchain Integration:** The Langchain library will be the core component allowing communication with the GPT model. Make sure to encapsulate this functionality into a well-defined service or set of functions within your application, so changes to the AI model or library can be managed effectively.

4. **Task Management:** This includes a service for managing the tasks that users create. This will involve creating a Task model, and methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks (CRUD operations). SQLAlchemy can be used as an ORM for interacting with SQLite.

5. **SQLite Database:** SQLite will store user data and task data. You'll need tables for Users, Tasks, and potentially Sessions if you're managing session data on the server side.

## Frontend - SolidJS Application

The frontend of the application will be built with SolidJS. It'll need to be a dynamic single-page application (SPA) to offer a modern, responsive user interface. 

1. **User Interface Components:** Break down your user interface into reusable components. This could include things like NavigationBar, UserRegistrationForm, LoginForm, TaskList, TaskForm, and AIChatBox.

2. **State Management:** You'll need a way to manage state in your application. This could be user data, session data, current tasks, and the current state of interactions with the AI. SolidJS comes with its own reactivity system that can be used for this.

3. **API Client:** Implement a client for interacting with your backend API. This can be as simple as a set of functions that use the fetch API to make requests to your server.

4. **Routing:** Implement routing to manage different views in your application, such as a Home view, a Login view, a Registration view, and a User Dashboard view. SolidJS has a library called solid-app-router that can be used for this.

5. **Error Handling and Feedback:** Implement a system for catching and displaying errors to the user, and for showing feedback when actions are successful.

## Directory Structure

Here's an idea for the initial directory structure based on your single repository approach:

- **root**
  - **apps**
    - **api** - Backend Python app
      - **models** - SQLAlchemy models (User, Task)
      - **services** - Business logic (Langchain integration, task management)
      - **views** - API endpoint views
      - **tests** - Backend tests
    - **web** - Frontend SolidJS app
      - **components** - SolidJS components
      - **routes** - Application views and routing
      - **services** - API client and other services
      - **states** - Global state management
      - **tests** - Frontend tests
  - **docs** - documentation
  - **scripts** - Utility scripts (deployment, setup, etc.)

This should be enough to get you started on the MVP. Note that it's very important to validate your ideas quickly, so don't get too bogged down in creating the perfect application from the start. Make sure to iterate on your ideas and keep an open line of communication with your potential users.
