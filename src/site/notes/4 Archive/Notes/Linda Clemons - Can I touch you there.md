(joined 45 minutes of the 2 hours in)

The thing you think of the longest, will happen.

## Body Angles
**Connect heart to heart, belly button to belly button, for at least 2 minutes.**

Feet don't lie. They're pointed where someone wants to go.

Women stroke the supersternal notch when they are nervous.

Palms expose when you're telling the truth.

Read in…
- Clusters: read multiple signals
- Congruency: if the words and the moves don't agree, something is going on
- Context: wrong clothes? Out of context. Weird question or behavior.
- Culture: when in Rome do as the Romans do. Hand symbols mean different things.

**If you see a shoulder shrug right after asking a question, negate the answer.**

Lip compression = they're holding back. Even worse “holding a key,” twisting wrist in front of their mouth.

## Body language in dating
**Undress with your eyes. But men, do it slowly.**

Here are some keys: some of these will open you up.
Courage. Confidence. Clarity. Compassion. Empathy. Listening. Body language. Spirit. Faith. Hope.

Quite often we are missing microexpressions because we're so in high tech.

You can touch another person around the world just with energy. Think about the love.

MW Quest trailer looks awesome. Women only? Not sure.

A person who is being deceptive can tell a story forwards but not backwards. Deceptive = looking straight ahead, talking rather quickly. They only practice words not gestures.

If you try to fake it, the fake will fade.

When you are uncertain about what you're proclaiming, you shift aside or backwards. Hold your ground.
