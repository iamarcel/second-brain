We need to talk about folders, links and tags simultaneously because they work in concert. They’re the orchestra, you’re the conductor.

Quick and dirty rules:
- Use less folders than you’re comfortable with
- Use more links than you’re comfortable with
- Links are strong connections, tags are weak ones

Why work with knowledge and have a hand tied behind your back?
