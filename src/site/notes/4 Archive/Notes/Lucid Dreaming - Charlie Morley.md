In most people's first few lucid dreams, they realize they're dreaming and wake up instantly.

The next time you have a lucid nightmare, stay in the dream for as long as possible. **Cutting a nightmare short means you necessarily have to take it again.** It's am internal therapy session.

Lucid dreaming is realer than real. That's not hyperbole. It's 4K HDR.

As you are conscious within the unconscious in a lucid dream, you can choose to do healing in the dream. Everything you can heal through hypnotherapy you can heal through lucid dreaming. But the depth is far deeper.

Often once lucid dream is all that's needed to heal.

Lucid living: lucid dreaming teaches us that our what we perceive is an illusion—in our sleep and that transfers to our days.

Lucid dreaming is EEG verified.

Neuroplasticity is engaged in lucid dreams. So there is actual practice and learning in there.

People actually improved squats and martial arts after training it in lucid dreams.

It's one of the most powerful trauma integration treatments in existence.

As far as the brain is concerned you're awake when your prefrontal cortex is activated.

How to heal trauma: **Because this is a dream, I have nothing to fear.** Then change the outcome with your magic powers.

Always make sure you have a dream plan, a really good reason to have a lucid dream.

Hug everything in your lucid dream.

Please go and see this teacher. Tell him Charlie sent you and he will make time for you. Ask him what to lucid dream about.

Practice can take weeks or months.

**You sleep a third of your life. Make it useful.**

2 hours extra sleep dramatically increases probability of lucid dreams.

You can have full blown lucid dreams during naps. Really really good.

You don't need to learn to lucid dreaming, you need to remember.

It's way easier to access when you access your inner child. Don't take it too seriously.

Buddhists believe flying in your lucid dreams is really good.

Like your other psychological self-defense mechanisms, in your dreams there seems to be a mechanism protecting you from bad things.

In your dream you're not there to be an tourist you're an explorer. Go straight into the dream plan.

Go big on your dream plan. This might ne the last day you're alive.

Put a lot of effort in writing your plan. Show your dreamer you care about it.

The vast majority of your healing will be nom-lucid. Even if you have one lucid dream a week, 98.5% of your dreams are non lucid. If you find answers in non lucid dreams they count too.

## Workshop
### Techniques
The dream plan is the most important part of lucid dreaming because it is the why, the rest comes after.

If your dream plan does not excite you, make you salivate, make a other one. You should be thinking, fuck man if this would happen for real that would be awesome.

### Dream recall
We dream to integrate learning and process trauma. We all dream and we have to, otherwise we get into psychosis.

When stuff you last seriously try to remember your dream?

Set that intention before you go to sleep tonight. Hypnagogic state is where you nod off—engage a sefl-hypnotic suggestion: tonight I remember my dreams, I have excellent dream recall. Repeat 21 times.

If you regularly have those jerks falling asleep you might be a little sleep deprived. Or it could be genetic.

Write down dreams to
- Remember them
- Find patterns, which improves lucid dreaming

You can recall with phone, writing, voice recording, poemz dancing. You don't need to write loads and loads.

You can write your dreams in the middle of the night.

### Dream Signs
Take note of signs that show you're dreaming. That creates a critical reflective mind, training you for lucid dreaming. Train this in your waking state too.

Types:
1. Anomalous, one-off crazy things
2. Thematic, for example back to school
3. Recurring dream signs. These are golden opportunities to go lucid.

Watch science fiction before bed. To bring weirdness into your dream.

### Reality Checks
If you are in a pre lucid dream state, we know certain things your mind cannot do.

Ask your mind to make a detailed pattern twice in a row. For example look at the complex pattern on the palm of your hand twice when turning it around. Or try to read the same thing twice.

Train this during the daytime. Every time something weird happens, do checks during daytime.

**The important bit is asking yourself every time something dreamlike happens in life, could I be dreaming?**

Doing this practice also brings mindfulness.

### Columbo Method
Look for evidence & alibi.

Ask the alibi: how did I get here? Does it make sense?

### Intent
In the hypnagogic state, in a brief awakening in the second half of the night, set the intention to be aware of the next dream.

I am a warrior of the dream state, I stay lucid and conscious while dreaming.

# Week 2: Science, Understanding Dreams
## Dream Signs
Any improbable, impossible or bizarre aspect of a dream experience that can indicate we are dreaming.

One of the main reasons we write down dreams is so we can learn to recognize it.

Types:
- Anomalous (ninja babies)
- Thematic
- Recurring

Acknowledging dream signs when awake sets up triggers for lucidity. Because we build the habit of **critical reflection** that we need during the dream.

Most common lucid dream is dream sign initiated: wow that's crazy I must be dreaming.

Recurring dream signs are recurring opportunities for getting lucid.

Action: DS - Dream Sign. add it to dream nots.

## Seeing Through Illusion in Life & Dreams
If we don't live looking closely for the signs, we will dream not looking closely.

## Manifesting Dream Signs
Just like the sailor doesn't control the sea, no dreamer controls the lucid dream. Respect it, know it, understand it, that you can navigate it as if you're in control.

You can't control the dream, but you can make friends with it.

The 1%. 99% of your lucid dream is yourself. But 1% is collective consciousness, ancient archetypes, dead relatives, perhaps enlightened beings.

90% of children between 6 and 16 report lucid dreams. The archetype of your inner child probably remembers.

**Intentionally manifest dream sighs.**
- Choose dream sign you want to manifest
- Recite the dream sign manifestation affirmation ("e.g., tonight I dream of Kanye and when I do I know I'm dreaming")
- Repeat that step 7 times with enthusiasm
- Then move on to the dream recall affirmation

MW: I should do this with running away!
