# Learnings
- Talk was declined because there was already the AI Summit and they didn't want any competition, I suppose. Or they just felt the topic was already exhausted.
- I gave two workshops as Tribe events instead.
	- First one was roughly based on this and explained people how to use ChatGPT. They had a more basic understanding than I had expected.
	- Second one was [[4 Archive/Notes/MVU 2023 Talk - Artificial Intelligence for Business\|MVU 2023 Talk - Artificial Intelligence for Business]] where we walked through a specific task: analyze a product and build a pitch website for it in one hour. They didn't believe it but we made it.
- Non-technical people don't connect with any abstract talk about AI, they need extremely specific things
- People understand AI is extremely powerful, and that attracts them to learning about it. But many are below level 5/10, e.g., the lady I was talking to that runs her entire business on a Google Sheet. So I'll end up teaching a lot of non-AI stuff like Airtable.

## Some Quotes and Principles
1. In a decade, you'll have two types of companies: the ones that fully embrace AI, and those that are bankrupt. – Peter Diamandis
2. GPT-4 is not a tool to search for information. It's a tool for reasoning about existing information. This means the data you have becomes more and more valuable. – Dan Shipper
3. Artificial Intelligence is a prediction machine. We used to intertwine prediction with judgement, but this will change. ("What's going to happen if X?" vs "What should I do now?") The value of good judgement will rise exponentially. – Tiago Forte
4. You can only embrace what's happening today with a child's learning mindset. Start tinkering and lean in to your curiosity.
5. Understand the strengths and limitations of Generative AI. Don't try to make it solve your most difficult problems. Instead, delegate simple time-consuming tasks.
6. AI get you to Pareto efficiency much quicker. You can get to 80% quality with 1-20% of the work. Those who disrupt industries will be those who embrace imperfection.

## Words from Vishen
- If you're not using ChatGPT, you're already obsolete
- It can save 1-2 hours per day of your work
- The more I dove into ChatGPT, the more shocked and surprised I am by just what is possible
- The skill that is emerging in the world is prompt engineering
