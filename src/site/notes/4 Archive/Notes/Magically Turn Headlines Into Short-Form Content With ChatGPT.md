The best way to leverage short-form content is to test "outlines." Then, turn your highest-performing short-form into valuable long-form assets.

**[[4 Archive/Notes/Lean Writing\|Lean Writing]] is all about validating ideas out in the market before doubling-down and investing time in creating longer-form versions.**

You can easily do this by creating & publishing bulleted lists that “outline” each of your ideas—and you should publish these outlines to start gathering data.

We call this writing “**Outlines As Content**.”

Just pick an idea. Then pick 1 problem inside that idea. And then do it again. Keep going down the problem list, getting more and more specific, until you reach a point where you literally can’t get any more specific.

The goal is to write a “long-form headline” that essentially summarizes exactly what you want to write about (Topic), FOR WHO (audience), SO THAT (they can achieve some sort of outcome).

Every single piece of writing, in some way, is a list.

**At the end of the day, all great “writing” is basically just a Jenga tower of ideas stacked on top of each other.**

It means every time you write something “short,” what you should really be doing is testing to see whether or not this batch of ideas (this list) is compelling to readers. Because IF IT IS, then it becomes extremely clear which of those “outlines” is worth expanding into longer-form content.

There are a million possible things related to your topic you could give them—you don’t have to just give the reader a list of tips.

•   Give them the **steps**
    
•   List all the **questions**
    
•   Curate all the **tools**
    
•   Name the **mistakes**
    
•   Etc.
