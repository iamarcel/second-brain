To succeed in life, do the opposite of what you learned in school.

What you have today is magic: phone, mobile data, social media.

Social media = people congregate around topics. And that's a goldmine.

Deal-making creates cashflow. Link things or people and watch the cashflow come in.

Take someone with a problem, arrange a meeting with someone who has a product.

Three Pâ€™s:
- Problems: look for them. **Ask everyone, what's your current biggest challenge?**
- (Umm forgot)
- Proposals: start to send out as much proposals as you can. Just video message. Make proposals where you only earn when the other earns.

You need three things in life:
- Bulletproof blueprint
- Tribe or community that holds you accountable
- Someone who gives you feedback
