## Present
[[Blissipline\|Blissipline]]: Don’t make your happiness depend on external things. Blissipline is the \#1 discipline. Practice feeling happy.

Exercise: every morning, think about the day before and count every little tiny happy moment. You want the number to get close to 100.

**Forgiveness is a superpower.**

## Envision Your Future
I want you to rethink and revision your [[4 Archive/Notes/Lifebook\|Lifebook]] categories.

From these sessions you might have completely changed your possibilities and things you want to do in your life.

Think about a few of the goals in your life that maybe you want to stretch now.

**Ask.** You can’t be saved by your guides unless you ask.

You have two communities:
- Your physical community
- Your spiritual community that’s always there and always has your back
