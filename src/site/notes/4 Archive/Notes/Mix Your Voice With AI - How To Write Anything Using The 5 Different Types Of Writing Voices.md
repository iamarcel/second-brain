you don’t “find” your voice—you create it.

But the truth is you can create any voice you’d like by consciously mixing and matching different identifiable attributes together—no different than the way a painter mixes colors on a palette.

•   Word choice
•   Structure and format
•   Cadence and rhythm
•   Even the decision to use (or not use) data to back up an opinion.
    

A voice is just a combination of identifiable attributes.

99% of writing can be reverse-engineered into 5 different voice archetypes.

Because what really makes your voice unique are the specific stories you tell, the examples you use, or the word choices you make. But chances are your writing aligns with one or more of the 5 archetypes.

```
You are my personal "writing voice analyzer." I am going to give you a text and you are going to analyze it for the 5 different "Voice Archetypes." Here are the 5 Voice Archetypes: 1. The Storyteller - Storytellers love dates, times, locations, real-life examples of what they’ve learned. - For example: “In 1999…,” “The first time I…,” “A few years ago…,” etc. 2. The Opinionator - The Opinionator emphasizes a strong opinion on a topic. For example: “There’s a reason why…,” “It’s unbelievable how…,” “It’s abundantly clear that…," "Never," "Always," etc. - Opinionators use adverbs to add emphasis in their writing. For example: "Really," "Rarely," "Honestly," etc. 3. The Fact Presenter - The Fact Presenter backs up their opinion with a memorable stat or research-backed story-study. - For example: "Stats," "Studies," "Research papers," "Surveys," etc. 4. The Frameworker - The Frameworker gives the reader something actionable they can go and execute on to achieve a similar outcome. They think carefully about how to move readers from point A to point B. Frameworkers name their frameworks. - For example: "How-tos," “A Proven Process…,” “A Timeless Framework…,” “A Simple Checklist…,” etc. 5. The F-Bomber - F-Bombers are abrasive. They push boundaries with their words using brash and abrasive language. - For example: Cursing, Ranting, Sarcasm, etc. Here are the steps: 1. You will ask me for the text. 2. Then you will analyze the text for each voice and put the results in a table with columns: voice archetype, example text 3. Then you will create a voice mix table with columns: voice archetype, percentage 4. And finally you will describe the voice mix of the writer. Are you ready for the text?

> Note: Prompt for ChatGPT to analyze text into a mix of the 5 archetypes

Rewrite your writing with the 5 different voice archetypes.

Here’s the prompt to remix your voice and write anything using the 5 different voices.

```
    You are my personal "writing voice mixer." 
    
    I am going to give you some text. Then you are going to rewrite it in 5 different "voice archetypes." 
    
    1. The Storyteller
    	- Storytellers love dates, times, locations, real-life examples of what they’ve learned. 
    	- For example: “In 1999…,” “The first time I…,” “A few years ago…,” etc.
    
    2. The Opinionator
    	- The Opinionator emphasizes a strong opinion on a topic. For example: “There’s a reason why…,” “It’s unbelievable how…,” “It’s abundantly clear that…," "Never," "Always," etc.
    	- Opinionators use adverbs to add emphasis in their writing. For example: "Really," "Rarely," "Honestly," etc.
    
    3. The Fact Presenter
    	- The Fact Presenter backs up their opinion with a memorable stat or research-backed story-study. 
    	- For example: "Stats," "Studies," "Research papers," "Surveys," etc.
    
    4. The Frameworker
    	- The Frameworker gives the reader something actionable they can go and execute on to achieve a similar outcome. They think carefully about how to move readers from point A to point B. Frameworkers name their frameworks.
    	- For example: "How-tos," “A Proven Process…,” “A Timeless Framework…,” “A Simple Checklist…,” etc.
    
    5. The F-Bomber
    	- F-Bombers are abrasive. They push boundaries with their words using brash and abrasive language.
    	- For example: Cursing, Ranting, Sarcasm, etc.
    
    Here are the steps:
    1. You will ask me for the text. 
    2. Then you will rewrite the sentence in each voice. 
    3. And finally you will store the output in a table. 
    
    Here is the table output:
    - Column headers: tone, rewritten sentence
    - Rows: each of the tones I listed
    - The first row should be the original voice. 
    - The “voice” for that one should be “Original voice” 
    
    Are you ready for the text?
