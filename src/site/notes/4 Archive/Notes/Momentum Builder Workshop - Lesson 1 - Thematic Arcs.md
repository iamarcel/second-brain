Part of the ‘secret sauce' that makes our campaigns so successful is the way we create **thematic arcs** that tie our writing and messages together, *pulling* readers forward, step-by-step from beginning to end.

It's *really* easy to get caught up in a literary-focused rabbit hole. We recommend, instead, that you think about theme from the 10,000′ perspective.

•   Where do you want your prospects to *arrive* — for example, purchasing something you've created?
•   Where are you *first* engaging with them — for example, in a Facebook ad?
•   What is the *context* for that first engagement — for example, are you known to the prospect (by reputation) or completely unknown (i.e., they're a ‘cold' prospect)?
•   How many touch points will you have between first contact and the first opportunity to purchase?

Once you have that, identify a theme that connects the dots from beginning to end. (Good vs. Evil is a great place to start. We're particularly fond of Courage & Perseverance as well.)
