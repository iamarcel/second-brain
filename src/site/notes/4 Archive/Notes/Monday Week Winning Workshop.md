# Mindset Session Timeline
## Celebrate
It’s amazing that you’re here, before the week starts. You’re, right now, showing your dedication to excellence and continual improvement. You’re saying “no, an average life is not enough. I want to do it better.”

So I want to celebrate you for that. And give yourself credit for taking this big step.

## Confront
If we leave the week to chaos, we live the week in chaos.

To win the week, we need to prepare.
Having an **intention** for how we want to behave, has a huge impact on how we will actually behave.
Understanding our **core tasks** for this week allows us to laser-focus on what matters, and celebrate that we succeeded.
Preparing for **stressful moments** will let us go through them with ease.

## Workshop
- Meditative state
	- Think of 3 things you’re grateful for
	- Feel gratitude
	- Connect with your highest self
	- Imagine going through the week as that person
	- How do they walk? Talk? Move? What do they do?
	- Feel that this could be you. The week didn’t start yet, you can still choose.
- Mindset
	- Let’s start writing.
	- Write down what kind of person you want to be next week.
	- Are there specific events where you want to pay particular attention to? Present yourself a certain way?
	- What will you be working on? Let’s decide on your Friday Finishers. Make a list of the most important things to have done by Friday.
	- Keep this list with you the entire week. Try to get them done. Make it stretch you. It’s okay that you didn’t end up doing all of them—you moved forward and that’s what matters.
	- Look at your calendar. Is there something that you feel like is worrying you? Stressing you out? Write down a list of these things.
	- Take time to think about how you can handle them. Prepare? Do something earlier in the week?
- Finishing up
	- Let’s return to now. Breathe.
	- Imagine the day ahead going perfectly. Hour by hour.
	- What will you be grateful for at the end of the day? Try to find something.
	- Decide, for yourself, right now, that you’ll try to be your highest self today.

# Invitation email (Nexup): Let’s Win Next Week, Together
My friends—

(Btw, this is the last email I’ll send directly to the Nexup team—more on that later.)

Do you prepare yourself at the start of the week? To:
- Start it with the right mindset
- Get clear on your most important tasks
- Make sure you *enjoy life* in the meantime

I don’t most of the time so that’s why I want to do it together with you—no excuses :)

For real, this can make a huge difference in your experience.

More focus and more progress.
Less distraction and wasted time.
A deep knowing you’re working on the right thing.

Next Monday, before the week starts, I’ll host a short workshop to help us get clear, ready and fired up

Want to join? Put this in your agenda:
**Monday, August 1 · 08:30 – 09:00**
**Video call link: https://meet.google.com/qkb-ndbn-ivj**

Hope to see you there!

Oh, about the dramatic “last email” thing:

I don’t want to keep spamming all of you if you’re not interested in this stuff.

So I’ll move this to a proper mailing list. If you want to keep hearing from me, [join here](https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/i2n1t4). You can also send it to friends or remove yourself from the list at any time. It’s no longer a KPMG-only thing now :)

Much love,
Marcel
