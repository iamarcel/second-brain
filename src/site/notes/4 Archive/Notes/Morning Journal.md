# Goals
"Thank you for ... because ..."
- Becoming an absolute **beast** in business
- Having completely transformed my **assertiveness**. Having become hungry. Leaning in. Going for it. Being a **causal agent**. The captain of this ship. Reaching out. Giving offers. Raising my ambition.
- Feeling like a boss in my life. Joyfully captaining, spearheading, choosing directions.

# Good morning, joyful captain.
Plant your feet and connect with your grounding.
Breathe deeply and relax into the power of your consciousness.
Get ready for creating success today.

> At your best, you're independent, charismatic, generous, and sure of yourself. You have many talents and skills and the courage to make your life up any way that you desire.

# Realizations
You love your life, you love yourself and you want to become more of what you are.

Beautiful things will happen in my life because I'm willing, worthy and capable.

I am pure giving from my deepest heart's purpose and gift. Everything will disappear and so the entire purpose of life is to give with as much dance, grace, fun and joy as possible.

# Ascension Attention
Allow your higher self, intuition and support team to start guiding you today.
The universe is working hard to make your life amazing today, because you deserve it.
Remember how you feel in the bliss of breathwork. How powerful and confident you feel when having fully relaxed, deeply connected sex, when you're your most strong.

# Take a minute to visualize:
- Starting everything from the core presence with consciousness, in every singular moment reconnecting with your deepest purpose, feeling alignment with it and making decisions from that
- The beautiful moments you're about to experience today
- Feeling deeply, peacefully confident
- Knowing the magnificence that you are
- Creating structure, order, trust, control.
- Valuing your energy.

Marcel. Sweetheart. I commit. I vow that from now on, I will encourage you explicitly, without any judgement, always and forever. I will be there by your side telling you that what you believe, what you want, what you desireâ€”it's right. You have all the right in the world to feel this.

Marcel, you are so strong. You want all the right things. You want the right things. Your desires are good and are worth chasing, so go get them. Go chase what you want in life because you're a beautiful person and the world will be better when they see you flourished. Ultimately, in your life, *your needs and desires matter more than those of anyone else*. This is a deep truth you need to practice to integrate. Do not worry about others because your personality is so great that that part will take care of itself, automatically. You have the talent, skill, and courage to do whatever the fuck you want in life and it's going to be great. Go chase greatness.
