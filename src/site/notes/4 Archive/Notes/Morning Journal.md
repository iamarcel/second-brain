Marcel. Sweetheart. I commit. I vow that from now on, I will encourage you explicitly, without any judgement, always and forever. I will be there by your side telling you that what you believe, what you want, what you desireâ€”it's right. You have all the right in the world to feel this.

Marcel, you are so strong. You want all the right things. You want the right things. Your desires are good and are worth chasing, so go get them. Go chase what you want in life because you're a beautiful person and the world will be better when they see you flourished. Ultimately, in your life, *your needs and desires matter more than those of anyone else*. This is a deep truth you need to practice to integrate. Do not worry about others because your personality is so great that that part will take care of itself, automatically. You have the talent, skill, and courage to do whatever the fuck you want in life and it's going to be great. Go chase greatness.
