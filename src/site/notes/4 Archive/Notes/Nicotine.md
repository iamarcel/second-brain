- Stimulant with a host of positive brain focus effects
    - Nicotine can offer acute cognitive benefits, primarily in attention, reaction time, and some aspects of memory.
    - Not a super-clear demonstrated positive-only thing but there's more positive research being released.
    - Danger in addiction and overuse—be careful, take low doses that take get processed relatively slowly by your body so the addiction doesn't come up.
- Resources
	- [Huberman has a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXs-zPc63kM), just skip over the bits about smoking
- Primary Demonstrated Benefits (Short-Term & Acute):
    - **Attention:**
        - **Alerting Attention:** Improved ability to maintain an alert state (e.g., sustained attention tasks) [PMC3151730].
        - **Orienting Attention:** Faster redirection of attention to relevant stimuli [PMC3151730].
        - **Focused Attention:** Enhanced performance on tasks requiring focused visual scanning [https://www.nature.com/articles/1395700](https://www.nature.com/articles/1395700) .
    - **Reaction Time:** Faster responses in tasks requiring quick decisions and motor actions [https://www.nature.com/articles/1395700](https://www.nature.com/articles/1395700]) .
    - **Memory (Specific Aspects):**
        - **Working Memory:** Some studies show improvements in reaction time on working memory tasks [PMC3151730]. Accuracy improvements are less consistent.
        - **Short-Term Episodic Memory:** Potential benefits for accuracy in recalling recently learned information (e.g., word lists) [PMC3151730].
- Side effects
	- Addiction of course
	- Primary side effect is nausea, usually when people take higher doses
	- Vasoconstriction - so it's primarily a "sit down and focus" type of effect, not for working out. You might stack with something like [[L-Arginine\|L-Arginine]] that's vasodilatory if you want to counter that.
- Practical Application & Protocol Guidelines
	- Use when you need the cognitive effects, not continually
	- The quicker the absorption the more addiction potential. Inhalation gets to your brain immediately which is why it's the most dangerous. Though the skin or digestive system are much safer.
	- **Lowest Effective Dose:** Start low (e.g., 1 mg nicotine lozenge or gum) and monitor effects.
	- **Timing:** Administer 30-60 minutes before the desired cognitive effect (based on absorption times for the chosen method).
	- **Method:**
		- **Gum/Lozenges:** Offer more control over dosage and faster onset than patches.
		- **Patches:** Provide a more sustained release, but less control over acute effects. Not generally recommended for cognitive enhancement due to slower onset and potential for tolerance.
		- **Sprays:** what I use—not much "extra shit" in next to the actual nicotine.
- **What We Still Don't Know (Key Research Gaps)**
    - The long-term neurological effects of isolated nicotine supplementation. It's been almost only researched in as smoking or vaping—which universally shows negative consequences leading to the "bad rep" of nicotine.
    - Interactions between nicotine and other nootropics.
    - Precise dose-response curves for various cognitive domains in different populations.
    - Whether these results can translate beyond rodent models.
