Orgasmic potential.

1 = never orgasm
10 = full blown half hour orgasms

Regular orgasm: crotch sneeze & snooze.

There are so many types of orgasm: heart, neck, ear,â€¦

Orgasmic states norish soul & body. Different way if connecting deeper. Portal to higher states if consciousness and self-discovery.

### Exploring
It all starts with self-pleasure.

The way we pleasure ourselves translates into the way we have sex with our partners.

### The principle of full body orgasm
Penetration sex is usually 3-7 minutes. 50% of men ejaculate after 2 minutes.

Foreplay is often too short for women. Dry vagina = friction, too much ejaculation for the man.

Instead of focusing on the end goal, getting out of the future, focus on the moment-to-moment feeling. Relax. **Don't have an orgasm, become an orgasmic being.** Move it in and up yourself.

**One of the tools is shaking.** Orgasm and shaking is chicken and egg. You can allow it and induce it.

Take sexual energy. Chi. Kidneys for women, testicles for men.

What happens to sexual energy when we move it up? Most of the time root chakra let's fuck. When it moves up it becomes higher frequency, lighter, up to other chakras. Water, fiery, love, mystical, visions, complete oneness. Light and expansive instead of not so primal.

### The Practice
Shake.
Awaken the snake. Pelvic tilt, attention to tailbone.

Five elements to move energy
- Breathing. Calmly, no holotropic breathing! E.g., tantra breath. Long deep diaphraghmic breathing, sip air as a straw.
- Sound. This creates vibration to help the surrender.
- Movement. When sitting for example, pelvic rotation.
- Internal movement. Kegel exercises. (Men, don't squeeze anus)
- Relax on every exhale. If you continuously relax it's almost impossible to have this climactic orgasm.
- Visualization. Energy goes up to the top of the heads then back down. You can use your hands to guide if you want.

Microcosmic orbit: touch your upper palate with your tongue.

On the other side of the peak orgasm, we have a valley orgasm.

Schedule an hour each week for self pleasure practice. Let is go to an 8, enjoy, down to a 4, enjoy, etc.

Do this exercise with a partner.

That energy when moved up becomes creative energy.

For men: it's not about not ejaculating, it's about bringing the energy up and in. Listen to yourself, if you really feel like you need to, ejaculate.
