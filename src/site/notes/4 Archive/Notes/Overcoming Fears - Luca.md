Challenge yourself every day a little bit more. Listen to your emotions and realize they're not a part of you.

Main Points:
1. Self-Awareness 
2. Trust the process
3. A little exercise: fear setting

Feelings are feelings and fear is just one of them.

## Fear Setting Exercise
What if I …quit my job?

*Define/Prevent/Repair: what is the worst case scenario? How can you prevent that from happening? If it were to happen anyways, how can you (partially) repair?*

### Define
- I go broke
- I end up doing exactly the same thing just as freelancer and now without colleagues around
- I'm overworked because I don't negotiate well

### Prevent
- Spend less and save more before quitting
- Move to a cheaper apartment
- Already start looking for work opportunities / earning on the side
- Make inventory of expenses & income streams
- Get into more communities to meet friends / other entrepreneurs
- Start sharing this intention to work for myself
- Train negotiating: follow training, ask for a raise at current job
- Research and learn pricing

### Repair
- Move back in with mom
- Find a new job (or even go back)
- I can always stop contracts as a freelancer

### What are the benefits of success?
Choice in work. 
Freedom to explore different roles, types of work.
This is what I need to learn to understand my best way to contribute to this world.
More time for developing my self.
Immense growth, becoming my own man.
Freedom of location—I can work from anywhere.

### What are the benefits of an attempt or partial success?
*Say you get 30% success, what good is that?*

- I learn a ton about freelancing, being self employed, I understand the market
- I will have to learn selling myself
- I'll meet new interesting people
- I'll have danced with and probably overcome a bunch of fears

### The Cost of Inaction
*How will you be emotionally, physically and financially?*

#### 6 Months
This in-between feeling of both content-ish in my job and happy they appreciate my work, but also feeling lacking.
Stress starts to slowly accumulate.

#### 1 Year
Bored with tasks at work.

Stressed out because I don't work with all passion >> caring less for health >> feeling even worse because of that.

Not much change financially, if I don't work as well and don't learn to ask for a raise this will stay.

Continuous doubt and uncertainty about my identity and path in life. This will send energy to all the people I meet and deteriorate relations with them.

#### 3 Years
Fucking hell if I’m still here in 3 years I’d feel like I lost at life.
There’s so much more to life and I’m just not taking it.
I’ll be stronger as I’ll keep going to the gym, but won’t have time to try out other things like the calisthenics.
Yeah would kind of feel like a failure.
I really don’t want to put up with this stuff longer.

### What are you waiting for?
Understanding the probability of failure (going broke): how long can I live on my own?
But really it’s just fear.
