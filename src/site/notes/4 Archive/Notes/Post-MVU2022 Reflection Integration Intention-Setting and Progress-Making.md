# Reflection, Integration & Intention-Setting

## Ideas
- Set up accountability partners
- Make sure MVU results in *action* for everyone
- Ingrain that consistency is key

Vishen already encouraged everybody to update their Lifebook, which my friends seem to be doing.

What to ask:
- What were your biggest insights from the past week or two weeks?
- What will you start, stop or continue doing once you get home?
- What will you do the day you get home?

### Four C’s
- **Celebrate**: we’re doing work that is so incredibly important in our life and we’re still so young. I’m incredibly grateful for this, and to have met a bunch of people who think the same way.
- **Confront**: if we don’t decide *right now* what we’re going to do—now we’re still in this high—and set up structures that help us succeed, we’ll just find ourselves two months later not having done anything
- **Challenge**: let’s get out of our comfort zone, and pull that out to outside of MVU. Set up calls to keep each other accountable.
- **Charge**: we can do this. When you go home, I want you to adopt a leadership position and inspire everyone around you.
