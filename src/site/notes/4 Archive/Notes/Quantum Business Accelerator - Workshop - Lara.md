Money is spiritual.

1. Quantum offer & quantum results so you can comfortably sell at 4 figs
2. Master high performance (focus)
3. Turn views into high-paying clients

# Quantum Offer
## The Two Main Pieces
### Context
- Values
- Vision / Mission
- Buy-In (Energetic; your customer knows what they're signing up for & they're willing to put in the reps)

As coaches we fuck up, but if our values & vision are clear our customers will be much more forgiving.

### Content
- Coaching
- Content
- Community

## Offer Foundations
**Sell results, not time.**
Time only exists within the 9-5.
Three niches: health, wealth, relationships.

WTC:: Warrior Transformation Code – that's how you communicate to others what you do.

### Bridge WTC
"I help X with Y so that you can Z without (OCD way) using (new way)."

- Avatar get certain result (or less complete like time management)
- Y is the "bridge skill"
- Z outcome

Better with "soft things" e.g., self-esteem and confidence.

### Direct WTC
"I help (who) get (what) without (old way) using (new way)."

Better with specific things like make 10K.

## Unique Program Name
Should be short, fun and give your audience a taste for what they're going to get.

## Content
3-5 main pillars, define the coaching and community too.

## Pricing
Two price points:
- Retail Price
- Fast Action Discount

Chunk up chunk down: my program is X but because we're on this call and I know you're going to do fantastic so I want to give you a fast action discount.

Feel free to copy-paste the financial qualification questions from Lara's Calendly.

## Insights
Your WTC is nothing except the first step in the selling process.
**The WTC is just a way to get to know your audience.** So you can start talking to them.

With a proper sales script, you can understand your customers' pains, based on that you make videos, then it that flywheels around.

Content: VSL and split into parts, each day is a different part of the VSL.

## A 10K month
4 sales = €12K
25% closing rate = 16 calls / month = 4 calls / week = 1 call per day
