It's all you. You're the dark force holding yourself back.

If you're not taking the actions you know you should take to become successful, you're not seeing the world in the right way yet.

The successful people just *see* the world in a different way. They think differently, so they act differently.

**If you're not making a lot of money, you're simply not deserving of it yet.**

So your paradigm of the world is wrong and is what needs to change.

**You need to become a different person.**

It's 80% mindset and 20% tactics.

Issues with society's current paradigm
- Misunderstanding in the psychology of the self and creation of the identity
- Bias towards the material and physical
- False perceptions of entitlement and authority
- Dualism and perception of one right and one wrong
- Contradiction of the two sciences
- Birth of the victim and their story
- Mistaken view of cause and effect

**Being out of my comfort zone is my comfy zone now.**

## Misunderstanding in the psychology of the self and creation of the identity
"PhD psychologists come here and I teach them about mindset."

People say "they're a natural" or "they're born with it"—but why believe this if you know you can be better?

**The nature of evolution is to become the best version of who we could be.**

Ignore the people saying to be authentic, not change who you are, fixing who you are.

Acting like a business man and feeling very inauthentic doing it—that's the only way to grow! It's not wrong to be something else than who you are if you're not in the situation you want to be in.

**Western philosophy is too focused on "who am I?"**

**We tend to build our lives around confirming what we think our identity is.**

The issue: humans naturally desire growth, but this contradicts all else.

All the successful people who went through this at some point had an identity crisis.

**The 'self' is an illusion, it's just who you *think* you are.**

**We live lives paralyzed as 'our selves' dreaming and full of regret about 'who we could have been'.**

### Removal of the static self for the becoming self
Well who are you really? Uhmmm there's nothing there. No no no this is me. Etc. Where is it? It doesn't exist.

It's impossible to grow if you're afraid of losing yourself. The only way to achieve success is to become the person who deserves it. The only question that's important is **who are we becoming?**

You've always got to have a hero. There should always be something to chase. **Make your hero you in a year.** Always be who you're becoming.

## The Becoming Self
- Who am I becoming?
- We're born into an environment and who we are becoming is a byproduct of our own thoughts, choice and actions.
- Accept that you can be whoever you want to be and achieve whatever you want to achieve.
- **Become whoever you want to be and don't feel bad about losing yourself in the process.**
- The self doesn't exist, it's merely an illusion clinging to an identity built up of stories about the past.

# Face Off With The Devil
Weird title, but this is probably the most profitable thing you can do.

**Life is more about managing your downside than managing your upside.**

If something's going on in your business, it's probably going on in your life too. So that's where to face it.

Everyone goes through struggles when they're trying to become successful.

**You need to know yourself because in business you're pushing yourself.**

Denial is the cause of all suffering, limitation and failure.

Facing the music: the cause of all success and happiness.

Life isn't just about when it's going well, but about when it's going bad.

"One side of me wanted to start my own business, and I quit my job and all, but I also didn't want to get out of bed."

## High Point and Low Point
Seemed like some internal thermostat that kept me between almost the same high and low points, to the average. This pattern existed in every area of life, e.g., amount of money.

Cleanliness of my apartment: how clean I wanted *to* as dirty as I could stand it.
Mental state of mind: how focused / sharp / determined, to the worst state you can bear.
Etc, etc.

As an entrepeneur, your mental state *really matters*. You can't be a bit foggy, even like what you get to in a 9-5.

All these things have high and low points...and they're all in sync.

> Pain can be an excellent teacher. If you learn to look it dead on in the eyes and face it rather than running away from it or sedating yourself, pain will teach you everything.

Boom and bust cycles = **you're living in denial**. It's when you don't take responsibility for your own actions and fool yourself by thinking you can act irresponsibly and not face the consequences. When you refuse to face the truth, the music, and wonder why you get burned and live an unhappy life.

## Facing the music
**You face the music when you face the truth front on and stop lying to yourself.**

Stop:
- Ignoring emails
- Not going out because you might meet someone you know
- Sweeping bad relationship under the rug

## Why these symmetric patterns happen and how to get out of them

Every action has an opposite equal reaction.

**Most people try to cheat cause and effect.** They know their actions will be bad as they're taking them, yet they do it anyways.

The mirror.

Your fears and judgements are only an outward reflection of how you think and behave.

Judging others makes you too afraid, especially if you don't speak your judgement.

How much you're confident charging for your stuff is a reflection of how much you're investing yourself.

Millionaires and billionares make decisions fast. Get used to making quick decisions—so your customers will too.

Sam has nothing for free. People who are obsessed with "free" won't be your customers.

You must become the client you want to attract.

Pay your vendors on time, every time. Make them think you're their best client. Tip well, be generous, give testimonials, say thank you.

## People don't have business problems, they have life problems that reflect in their business

## How you do one thing is how you do everything
If someone's late with one thing, they're late with everything: deadline, sleep in, relationships, going to bed,...

Every time I cleaned up, like saying sorry to people, becoming a better person—my business exploded more.

Start making a list of all these little things you've done. Because you're probably experiencing a reaction somewhere.

The way someone rides a bike, reads a book, goes to the gym—all the same speed, intensity, tempo. So start understanding your own tempo.

You can turn it. You can change anything. I went from 30 minutes focus a day to being able to focus for 18 hours for months on end.

**Commit to excellence in every facet of your existence.**

Home and office in immaculate condition all the time. Drink tons of water.

Show up to work like it's serious.

**Clean up your entire mind and entire environment because it'll make more of a difference than anything else.**

## We become our lowest standards, not our highest dreams
In reality life's more about managing the downside, because the downside is more dangerous. Because they're stuck longer and often it's more dangerous here.

**It's not about how much you make, but how much you keep. So the average of your highest and lowest points.**

All business does is 10x everything in your life. Every little problem will have a 10x effect in your business. All that exists is cause and effect. Chance is just misunderstood cause and effect.

# The Duality & Conflict of Man
## What is the duality and conflict of man? Why is it important?
This is how we think---how the mind is "programmed" to see the world.

**The only way the human mind can understand something is by comparing it to its opposite.**

If we remove "unhealthy" we can't know we're "healthy."

## How your mind works and how you make decisions
We see, smell, taste etc., with our *mind*, this turns information into *perception*. All we experience is perception, which can come from the environment or memory & imagination.

Our brain doesn't know the difference between real life and our imagination. (Example: feelings come back after remembering a painful memory.)

Something that often happens:
- One person tells someone "you can't do that" or something
- That person *replays* it again and again until the belief becomes cemented

Experiment: hot coal burning someone from the rear, skin actually blistered even when it was swapped for an ice cube.

### How you form beliefs
Tons of different "scales" with positive and negative experiences, per topic.

We can actually put rocks in these scales with our memories.

Your mind builds beliefs more from what happens in its imagination than from real experiences. And whatever way you stack the scales will become your belief.

Self-fulfilling: your belief will become your reality.

## The division of opposites and the two poles of nature
For everything we know, there's a duality.

## Who are you? The definitive answer and summation of mental programming
We think we are who we are from birth. But as we answer the question of who we are, we ask who we are *not*. Again we stack the scales.

Entire life, every experience, every thought of the past, every thought of the future---you stacked the scales for everything. So your identity is the summation of every scale you've ever stacked.

Your beliefs become your reality. Then we answer "who am I" so many times that it becomes very strong, and it becomes reality.

"I can't catch"---when people throw something we'll fumble. If we "can't handle the heat" we won't and we will stay in cool places.

We have defined "who am I" when the real question is "who am I becoming?"

We are not someone, we are always becoming someone.

## Society's conflict of opposites and perceived right and wrong
Society has defined who they are as the group, collective from the people. Simultaneously, it has defined what it's not.

Society defines what is right and what's wrong by opposites.

He who is not with me, is against us. He who is not like us, is our enemy.

The tragic thing is society has defined what it is, and by that created its enemies. Instead of defining who they are becoming.

## Mankind's big question
What is right and what is wrong?

Society thinks:
- Making money on wall street is wrong
- Meditating and doing wellness is right

- Being on the beach, in the forest, relaxing, is right
- Being in a polluted city, business, is wrong

- The past is more right
- The future is more wrong

- Happy and smiley is right
- Depressed and sad is wrong

- Science is accurate and right
- Religion is wrong

- Beggars, giving to charity are right
- Being greedy, making money is wrong

- Nature, exploring, travel is right
- Working is wrong

- Awake during the day is right

You have to choose a side. We have the perception that there is *one* right and *one* wrong.

The issue is: who you are right now is fighting who you want to become. In society this happens, too.

## The Answer
What we've done wrong:
- In trying to form an identity, we dream of being who our identity is not
- In destroying depression with antidepressants, we destroyed happiness through antidepressants
- In trying to remove religion through science, we turned science into a religion
- In trying to remove non-education through university, we introduced non-education through university
- In trying to forget money to achieve spiritual happiness, we end up unhappy because we need money

People used to start a business to gain freedom, but now they have all these investors breathing down their neck and they have more of a job than they used to.

All of this is people trying to totally remove one side. But it's inextricably linked to the other.

## The paradoxes have flipped
The only way to be wrong is to choose a side.

The universe is forever changing. The only way to lose is to resist change.

The equation of evolution: thesis --> antithesis --> synthesis.

<svg width="600" height="200">
  <circle cx="20%" cy="50%" r="80" fill="#1f4b99" />
  <text x="20%" y="50%" font-family="Arial" font-size="20px" text-anchor="middle" fill="#FFFFFF">Current Self</text>
  <rect x="35%" y="25%" width="30%" height="50%" fill="#d3d3d3" />
  <text x="50%" y="50%" font-family="Arial" font-size="20px" text-anchor="middle" fill="#000000">Unhappiness</text>
  <circle cx="80%" cy = "50%" r = "80" fill="#8b0000"/>
  <text x = "80%" y = "50%" font-family = "Arial" font-size = "20px" text-anchor = "middle" fill = "#FFFFFF">Desired Self</text>  
</svg>

We have come to believe this is the shitty truth of our existence. The gap between the current and desired self is the cause of all unhappiness. Desire is unhappiness. But it's not the shitty truth: we *can* change.

## The Alchemy View
There's nothing wrong with either sides of "the right and wrong." It's *both*.

If you only eat healthy food, the body forgets it's eating healthy food. Completely removing germs you end up sick because your immune system hasn't built up tolerance. Your body needs to be shocked back to know it was actually pretty good.

People who drop out and get educated *both* are actually way better.

Learn to enjoy some pain.

You don't need work-life balance if work is play.

What if you could get rich by giving back?

The key to evolution is variation. The only way to become our desired self is to look at what's in the dark.

We must understand that a firm side will eventually require us to face the opposite. We must understand that dualism exists and we need to lose the binary stance.

It's time to look at the other side of the duality elements.

**Who you are right now will not achieve your dreams.**

## Action items

Solve difficult problems together with smart creative people, make a lot of money and be ultimately free while continuously growing.
  
9.  Do you see how your current binary poles are in direct conflict with the dream you have for yourself?  Do you see that the things you dislike other people for and judge them by are the exact things you need yourself to achieve your dreams?  
Yeah. I need a little bit more selfishness and cold blooded striving to get what I want.

I'm committed to facing my dark side, the unspoken parts of me. I'm committed to changing so I can become someone else, the one who is highly capable of making my dreams come true.  

11.  Judging others makes it impossible to do anything bold yourself because of the fear that you will be judged.  Take a look at the people you disliked and why.  Now make a conscious decision to stop judging them and start loving them by taking the time to understand their point of view and agreeing with it.  Let go of everything you’re holding onto.  

Okay. Let's love selfish people because they really *do* have something going for them.

# Seeing for the First Time
**Everything in nature works as a [[Power Law\|Power Law]].** It's natural. Imagine complaining that 80% of the population lives in 20% of the countries. The same happens with income.

## Feedback Loops
This happens because of feedback loops.
**In feedback loops, cause and effect become self-fulfilling.**

What you think *about* is what you *think* and what you think is what you think about. This sets off a vicious cycle.

One tiny thought can set off a spiral and form a belief that then creates ultimate reality.

These cycles can be your best friend or your worst enemy.

This is the "burden of consciousness."

## Creating The Feedback Loops
"I'm going to master business"—and that kept looping positively.

Everything is interconnected, even if they are not related at all. It all ends up in his "Research & Development" directory. **Find interconnectedness between every two subjects.**

## Quantum Physics
Particles are in fixed positions when they're being observed. When not, they're everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

It turns out particles are extremely interrelated.
- Masses attract masses (gravity)
- In looking, particles attract more

Quantum entanglement, like they communicate with each other over arbitrary distances.

## Universal Theory of Everything
1984:
> He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future.

Sam: add one sentence: **this is all you.**

Think of entangled particles as *past* and *future*. They influence each other. The present is in the middle, you control this.

Live in the present. If you live in the past, it will dictate your future, and the other way around.

**It doesn't matter what's true, only what you believe is true because, with work, it will become true.**
