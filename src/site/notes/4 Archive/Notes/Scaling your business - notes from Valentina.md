# Scaling your Business

## SYMPTOMS OF CONTROL GAPS

- [ ] Calendar numbness
- [ ] Goal numbness
- [ ] Deadline numbness
- [ ] Last-minuteness
- [ ] Management by whiplash
- [ ] Repeatable processes: not standardized
- [ ] Repeatable processes: mistakes
- [ ] Lack of clarity (YPO Issue for the board members) 
- [ ] Lack of data visibility 
- [ ] Delayed response times 
- [ ] Inbox=gray area (Your inbox doesn’t need to get to zero every day maybe just once a week but make sure people are aware of this) - when you have spam on your inbox you’re creating numbness, which doesn’t contribute to scaling your business. 
- [ ] Clutter - Clutter is costly 
- [ ] Trusted system repels you 
- [ ] Team is down, leader is fine 

## ENHANCING CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY 

- Fewer priorities
- Weekly alignment meetings  
- Reporting and escalation
- Sacred inboxes
- Sacred calendar
- Sacred procedures
- Create an org chart
- Performance management
- What's the next action? Be always very clear and include deadlines 
- Separate out R&D projects 
- SSC Audit - Stop Stop Continue (Numbers, employee feedback and customer feedback) 
- Do more type 1 and type 3 work (type 1 is planned work, working off of your list / type 2 is unplanned work, when someone distracts you or you get an idea, type 3 is planning your work)
Scaling companies don’t die of starvation, they die of indigestion. 

(Too many goals, etc etc, everything last minute, too busy calendars)

Energy 


Lack of control takes a toll on your energy

Energy: 
- People but not only that. You’re going to hire high energy people and low energy people. 
- Not just time 
- If you’re high on energy you are going to be more strategic and do overall better 
- ENERGY IS ENGAGEMENT 

Top 4 drivers of engagement 
1. Source of ENERGY 
2. Line of Sight (vision)
3. Appreciation (what if every once in a while you make it recurring to drop a 2 minute note of appreciation to someone in your team?) Also specific appreciation in front of everyone 
4. Money 

businesses don't run out of CASH they run out of ENERGY. 

You can almost predict when someone is about to quit because they lose their energy 

Right now what’s your energy relationship with your business?
