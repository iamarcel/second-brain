# Adopt the leadership mentality

> We don't need more egoists on stage, we need more *leaders*.
> 

Most people are just trying to *survive* but make it all about *them* in that same move. Get out of yourself. Your *job* is to *serve these people*. That's what you're paid for. It's not about you anymore. It's about leading the people.

Take your responsibility and lead them. Get out of yourself and deliver the message they need.

> If you're not studying leadership in your life yet, you're *not even in the game*.

# Know the four C's

Understand these messaging themes before you plan out your speech and make sure you're delivering them.

- *Celebrate*: How are you going to celebrate the audience? Who and what for?
    - Why we're all here together
    - The theme of the event
    - What we've achieved
    - How we're growing
- *Confront*: What's the bad behavior you need to confront the audience with? Where did they screw up?
    - e.g., "You wanna do X, but you all know sometimes you're doing Y and you *know* it's holding you backâ€”don't you?" [raise hands]
- *Challenge*: What challenge do you want to issue to your audience?
    - People love a daily challenge
- *Charge*: What's the charge you'll give, the CTA at the end of the speech?
    - e.g., you can do this explicitly: "When you walk out of this room, I want you to ..."
    - This is the critical element to your messaging

# Know the themes and stars

This is what will keep you getting re-booked. If you don't tailor your speech to the event theme, your clients will think you just have one canned speech and they won't re-book you.

Interview the organizers about the event: what's the theme, why, what messages are you telling, what can I add to that?

Know two or something stars, top performers, founders, etc. so you can celebrate them during the speech. Acknowledge their hardship and get the audience to celebrate that.

# The three-story rule

Make sure you have at least three stories (and accompanying takeaways, of course) to tell.

These have to be *great, emotional* stories. Talk about vulnerability, hardship, underdog, the dreamer, etc.

- [ ]  Go through your life and remember the emotional stories. Zoom in on what you were thinking, feeling and believing at the time. Know their context. Make sure you know the major stories of your life.
Understand, too, that these don't need to be big or transformational. Sometimes the more everyday the story, the more relatable, so people feel it better.

> You can be the greatest trainer in the world, but without emotion you're nothing.
> 

## The Bounce

As you're telling stories, jump from you and the story to the audience and them. Say "you" while they think you're just telling the story.

**Never tell your story without bouncing it to the audience.**

# Break the barrier

Make the audience break their *physical* pattern. The more engagement you get, the more they'll love it. But make it *part* of the experience, make it feel natural.

You *must* give commands to move. People love this because so many speakers don't dare to do it. But this is why you will be brought back.

# Move like an animal

Move with urgency, need and vitality. Use the *entire* stage.

(B: "TED = censorship because they limit you and change your speech.")

# CTA Crescendo Loopback

This is the biggest point of the seven here.

End on a crescendo (not necessarily loud though). Make sure you've rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed your ending.

Bring a former point of the speech back during the crescendo and you're *boom*.
