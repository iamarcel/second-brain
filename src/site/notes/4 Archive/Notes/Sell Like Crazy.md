# Introduction
## Single Mother Work Ethic
Put. In. The. Work. Every. Day. Do something you don't want to do first thing every morning. Challenge yourself to be uncomfortable and push past the mediocre, the laziness, and the fear. Forge your work ethic and exercise it like a muscle. Strengthen it. Build it. Be relentless in your approach towards success.

Make your 'why' so big that the 'how' becomes obvious. The Little Bitch will test how badly you want it by trying to get you to stop the work.
