I've worked in tech for my entire life but I think the biggest job of technology is to disappear.

Nobody is waiting for interruptions, distractions and dopamine addictions.

What we're waiting for is machines that can be machines, so we humans can be more human.

Instead of making us scroll when we're together, social media should make us scroll *until* we're together, and then just fade away.

I wanted to show you a project today that's a step in that direction.

It's called the Daylight Computer. A tablet with a display like a book, that doesn't strain your eyes and is easy to read in the sun.

The operating system is simple, designed to let you just read and write without interruptions.

And it comes with a pen so you can write on it like a notebook.
