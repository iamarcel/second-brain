The [[Deep Code\|Deep Code]] hypothesis has been that the dynamic attractor of our current civilization (the set of institutions, structures, ideas, habits and feedback loops that keep things hanging together) is in the process of evaporation ([View Highlight](<https://instapaper.com/read/1312341354/13114185>))


As we have seen with 9/11 (Patriot Act) these things have a habit of becoming habit. ([View Highlight](<https://instapaper.com/read/1312341354/13114207>))


A crucial insight is that the operating logic of our current civilization has been to trade resilience for efficiency (creating fragility). From childcare, family, education and mental health, to supply chains for food, water, material and medicine (watch out for depletion of psychmeds), we’ve been optimizing everything to their limits for half a century. This generates short term profits and long term risk. ([View Highlight](<https://instapaper.com/read/1312341354/13114212>))


It is possible to have both abundance and anti-fragility. Hopefully this year we will begin to learn how to get there. ([View Highlight](<https://instapaper.com/read/1312341354/13114559>))


networks have done a vastly better job of making sense of the unfolding meta-crisis than official channels ([View Highlight](<https://instapaper.com/read/1312341354/13114579>))


The more we learn how to quickly use our capacity for communicating with nearly anyone in the world in multiple modalities (text, audio, video, symmetric, asymmetric) to orient our attention to the right information, people and projects and then to support coordinated action, the more we can move that agency from the old 20th Century hierarchical bureaucracies that currently run the world to much more flexible, adaptive, nuanced and intelligent 21st Century “self-organizing collective intelligences” (SOCI) that can fully respond to meta-systemic dynamics.

Upgrade your Sovereignty. Increase your ability to make effective choices under a larger diversity and intensity of contexts. There is a lot of room between panic and denial. In the future, everyone counts and has to be able to take responsibility. ([View Highlight](<https://instapaper.com/read/1312341354/13114593>))


Upgrade your Discernment. Increase your ability to separate signal from noise. In particular, the noise of your own biases and projections. Learn to deal with reality before reality deals with you. ([View Highlight](<https://instapaper.com/read/1312341354/13114595>))


The Japanese word “toku (徳)” (teh in Chinese), which is usually translated as “virtue,” also means “power” or “integrity.” Toku is the consciousness of the whole that makes your life coherent, consistent, and integral. Therefore, toku is integrity, and toku is also power because through toku your vision, action, and result become coherent and consistent. Success in life and business requires power to make your vision realized through action. Success thus requires integrity in the sense of toku.
