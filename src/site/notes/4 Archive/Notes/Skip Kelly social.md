Distilled notes from Laura

Move your hips

Pattern:
- **Hit**
- **Hit**
- **Surprise / funny**

You have 3 seconds to capture attention. Start with surprise.

Types of content:
- Funny, to prove you're a good person
- Educational, main transformational 
- Loving, if you're good just do one a month. People want to hug you.

Create content with a vision. Vision has to be extremely clear.

Share statistics, it's nice. 

Getting testimonials
- How were you before this?
- Why did you do this?
- How did it make you feel?
- Struggle before this
- Vision of how this would be
- Moment where you felt *wow*
- What are they going to do different
- What would they say to others who want to but are not sure
- **get your testimonial to the emotion you want them to feel**

Talk deeply, more intimately with interviewer. Gentle, soft, close.
