[[0 Inbox/Naval Ravikant\|Naval Ravikant]]: It's actually really important to have empty space.

Without time to think, you're not going to be able to have good ideas for your business. You're not going to be able to make good judgments. I also encourage taking at least one day a week (preferably two, because if you budget two, you'll end up with one) where you just have time to think.

It's only after you're bored you have the great ideas. It's never going to be when you're stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time.

That getting to know ourselves takes a commitment of time.
