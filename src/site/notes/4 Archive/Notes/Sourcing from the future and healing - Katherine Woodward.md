Today: the technology of future making.
Level below calling in the one, even.

It's not like this is new knowledge, but it's that we're open to receive it.

It's not enough to stand here with our own ambitions. It's time to take a stand and **have ambitions for humanity as a whole**. That's what we'll do here over these three weeks. Build consciousness and build a beautiful vision of the future for all of humanity.

**What if the darkness is not a tomb but a womb?**

Take your impulses seriously. Sometimes you know the future and it doesn't make any sense.

**Healing is the domain of the past, transformation is the domain of the future.**

You want to share your intentions, but with the people who can hold them with you. 6x more probable to manifest as opposed to yourself.

You can ==**“try on” your transformed self in meditation**==. Then ask the universe what you need to do to become that person. What will we need to give up? How do I need to grow? (Intrapersonal, interpersonal) Finally, what's my next step?

We give too much. We don't negotiate. It's so habitual.

Set unreasonable intentions to really make yourself take consistent actions. You not only do things but also *assign meaning* to what seems to happen by itself, but the universe.

Inside out technology: align who you are internally with what your heart wants to achieve.

Most are overly identified with the feeling in their body.

**steps: the future self system***

Music of her vision board: lucky in love.

==**Healthy identity is fluid. It's only traumatized identity that's fixed.**==

Intention exercise
My intention is to be a man.
What I have to do now: keep following goals and plans, recognize my progress and achievements to build self-confidence. Don't hold back love to anyone for whatever reason (or without reason).

Visioning your miracle intention, key questions:
- What does it look like, sound like, taste like, smell like, feel like to be living in this future?
- Who am I in this future fulfilled?
- What will I need to let go of to find my way to this future?
- How will I need to grow to prepare myself to receive this future?
- What’s my next step?

Self-love power practice, to this with someone else.
- Ask “What are you feeling?”
- They respond
- Just reply with “I can see that you’re feeling…”
- Do the same with “What are you needing?”

**This old broken part of our identity is something we often over identify with.**

If I feel it, it must be true. That's something we really need to learn to get ourselves out of.

Do the self love power practice often, so start to know your old self and learn to contain it.

**Attention is the currency of love.**

This is a practice you can do with yourself 20 times a day. What are you feeling I can see that you are feeling… what do you need? I can see that you need…

Affect labeling: language is a container. When we pause and label a feeling, we contain our response.

----

If you have issues with co-dependence, defining yourself as a mirror on what others are feeling—your primary place of attention is *out there*, not *in here*. It needs to first come from inside.

Question: my need is “I need to be kind to myself”; reword that to “I need kindness” because at that point it becomes a show of kindness to yourself.

Many of the things your heart yearns for feel impossible in the moment.

If I want to be able to talk to thousands of people, I better become someone who has something to say.

When naming your “traumatized self,” welcome in the feelings for a moment. Often we try to suppress them.

Exercise. Went back to being bullied time. Power statement: I am wanted; the most authentic version of myself is the most loved one.

Just feeling your shame is not growth. You just get stuck there. Thinking “what the F is wrong with me” is not what's helping you grow.

I spent years as a therapist. Listening to people. Thinking that I can love someone out of a story. But then I learned you *have to push* otherwise it doesn't happen.

I love people who don't think they're good enough because they overgive; then I tell them they are good enough, they stop over giving and I'm like “damnnm”

We don't present ourselves so don't give others the chance to show us we're good enough.

We can blame others a lot. **==But even if it's 97% they being a jerk, still take responsibility for the 3% that is you training them how to behave.==** 
You can still go back and make amends, I express myself badly then and trained you wrong.

This is what catalizes us, this *level of responsibility* for ourselves.

To access the power to evolve, you muse see clearly the specific ways you are responsible for your experience.

Notice how you're inadvertently pushing others into your negative beliefs.

**Your beliefs are relational. They were created in relations with others who matter to us. So they should be repaired in relationships with others too.**

The secret of belonging is that you generate it. It's not like waiting to be asked to join the party.

How long have you been asking yourself that question? Do you want to live to be 1000?

The danger is staying stuck in that past and solidifying that belief.

Empowering questions: what would I do for myself here? How will I regret giving away my power here? 

Pseudo safety strategies. They tend to generate evidence for our negative beliefs.

Step: identify skills and capacities needed to manifest and sustain showing up from the true you.

I most rather have you spend your next year learning to love your younger self, walk into the room with presence.

When you're mad at somebody they probably did something bad. We're pretty good at understanding that.
