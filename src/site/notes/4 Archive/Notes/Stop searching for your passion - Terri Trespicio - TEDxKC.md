You’re not going to get stuck somewhere, you’re stuck NOW!

You don't create your life first, and then live it. You create it by living it, not agonizing about it.

Don't loan money to people following their passion. Loan it to people who want to start a business—the more boring the better.

Success fuels passion more than passion fuels success.

We all think we know the kind of person we are and the kind of person we would love—but sometimes we're wrong and we're blissfully wrong.

It's okay to not know! Because the most fulfilling careers and relationships are those that can still surprise you.

Spend your time and attention solving your favorite problems.
Be useful and generous.
