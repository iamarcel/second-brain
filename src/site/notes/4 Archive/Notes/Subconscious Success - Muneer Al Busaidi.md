93% of communication is non-verbal, your internal chatter works the same way.

*The way* you talk to yourself is incredibly important, just like what you say.

## Auditory
Imagine the negative voice in your mind as a Mickey Mouse voice.

Power up the voice on the powerful voice.

## Visual
The mind must create what it has to negate.

“I don't want this” creates a limitless list, that's useless.

6 phase is visual.

## Kinesthetic
Physiology creates emotion.

## All together now
Combine them. Figure out what is most aligned with you.
