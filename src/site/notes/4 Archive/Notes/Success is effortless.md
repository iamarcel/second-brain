A large part of success is about getting your mindset right much more than *trying* to do things very hard. Let yourself be pulled towards who you want to be, by working on the identity *first*, instead of having to push yourself.

Of course [[4 Archive/Notes/To be happy, be able to hold paradoxes\|To be happy, be able to hold paradoxes]]. This is one of those paradoxes: success is simultaneously effortless and effortful.

# On Human Nature
## On Freedom
## On Fear
## On Motivation
A hallmark of those who achieve greatness is the discovery that they can control the level of motivation they feel by better directing their own minds.

People who are motivated, choose to use their minds in a more purposeful way in order to energize and lift their lives. And for that they tend to achieve more and gain more respect.

### Sparking Motivation
By deeply contemplating higher aims, we energize ourselves to pursue them.

### Sustaining Motivation
We must refocus. Giving our ambitions consistent mental attention keeps the drive alive, our energies swirling in anticipation. This can be as easy as reviewing our goals each day, journaling about our desires each night, regularly setting aside moments to visualize what we want and schedule our next steps.

It is the obvious equation and the ultimate secret: the deeper and longer I give attention to my ambitions and passions, the more motivation I feel.

We often forget that it is sweat and toil toward meaningful pursuits that makes us truly alive. ^cae854

### Amplifying motivation
Few things amplify our long-term motivation more than a positive social environment.

## Declaration IV: We Shall Advance With Abandon
The majority of the word's people are not advancing at the speed of which they are capable. It is like watching a cheetah stroll lazily all its life, never powerfully stretching and leaping at the staggering speed within its potential.

Reality is bendable.

Action is the yardstick of character.

We love ourselves only if we feel we deserve love by how we treat ourselves and others.

The higher we climb in life, the more we realize just how hard everyone has worked to achieve anything. Most people of influence earned their own way by discipline, struggle, and service.

### Struggle is to be expected and honored
We must remember that the power to direct our destiny comes only from a mindset that makes us willing to struggle through learning, effort, and growth.
