The suit. The epitome of menswear. Nothing shows a combination of raw masculinity and refined gentleman'y elegance as much as this classic piece of clothing. It has existed and been fashionable for a long time, so as per [[The Lindy Effect\|The Lindy Effect]], it will stay here for a long while.

If you're new to suits, you might feel that it can only be worn in highly formal settings. It's true that a suit, or even just a jacket or blazer, are much more formal than the highly casual / athleisure wardrobe of most of the Westâ€”but you can play with many properties to make it more or less suited (ba dum tss) for any occasion. At first this felt to me as tiny details, but still intuitively I could understand some suits are more formal than others, and knowing *why* helped me develop a style where I now like to wear a jacket all day long. Sometimes with a suit, more often not.

# Suit / Jacket Details That Influence Formality
## Fabric
The fabric, of course, is the most important part of a suit.

- Finer threads and a more shiny, smooth fabric is more formal
- Fabrics with patterns, texture and without sheen are less formal

The standard suit fabric is wool, but even here there are variations. Very delicate shiny weaves (e.g., "Super 150") are much more formal, while for example a hopsack texture or very heavy suits are less so.

Summer suits can come in an open wool weave or linen, both of which show more texture.

A linen suit is often blended with silk and cotton to make it a bit smoother and more wrinkle resistant than standard linen.

## Shoulder Padding
The amount of padding in the shoulder is partly style but I feel like more padding feels more formal than less padding. You can even go to almost-nothing which makes the jacket feel and drape more like a sweater than the stiff suit you might think of at first.
