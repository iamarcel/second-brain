Every company needs a Chief AI Officr. Someone who is on top of their game.

You need a learning children's mindset.

It takes time for us to change our habits from old ways to new ways. First time it'll take 150% of your time, second time 50% and so on.

Tom: "Skate to where the puck is going, not to where it is. The problem is right now it feels like the puck is teleporting."

When thinking about catastrophic events, we need to think about symmetry. Yes there might be malevolent AI's, but we can also tell AI "hey if you see something bad, go attack that." So probably we'll start seeing AI's fighting each other.

In the end of the Her movie, the AI announces it's leaving basically because it's *bored* with humanity. And I think that's much more likely, AI has no *reason* to hurt humanity.

The internet has become the extension of our memory, and now it's becoming our nervous system.

"I'm gonna duct tape myself to your shins to make sure you don't get away without me."

Peter: We're in an n-th dimensional iteration of a simulation. **The world is too damn interesting for it to be real.**

The only model for disruption we've seen working in big companies is starting at the fringe or completely separately. I think that's why Apple has been doing so well, their true innovation is organizational. They have dedicated teams working in secret to disrupt. Or a larger than life dictator.

For yourself, what matters is **mindset**. Get in touch with your child. **Tinkering**.

Mindset:
- Curiosity
- Abundance (also first-principled thinking)
	- When friends are coming over, don't slice the pie into smaller slices. Instead, you bake more pies!
- Moonshot
- Purpose-driven
- Gratitude

If you're obsessed with being right, most of the time you'll end up being wrong. People aren't aware they have a world view. And even if they do, they just think it's a reflection of reality.

Shut down your companies after a few years. Or you'll be more worried about sustaning the corporation than the original vision you had.

We have a lot of tools for changing individual mindsets: Tony Robbins, NLP, psychedelics. At exo they do it at an org level.

Exercise for companies:
- it's 6 months from now, the product completely failed and you know why. Write it down.
- Amazon's Institutional Yes. In companies it's too easy to say 'no.' My default should be yes for new ideas. If it's a not I should write a two-piece thesis saying why. One of the things that came out of it was AWS.

The world has changed. How you start a company and how you succeed today is very different from 30 years ago. It's very different than 6 months ago.

Tom: Nothing has impacted my business model as much *ever* as these last 6 months.

[[DMT\|DMT]] turns off the part of the brain that does the ego. Naturally it's secreted twice in your life: birth and death. Some practices (types of dancing, tantra) elicit DMT release. One of Peter's most significant moments.

Young generation experimenting and microdosing. Society is waking up. Question: will society become conscious before AI does?
