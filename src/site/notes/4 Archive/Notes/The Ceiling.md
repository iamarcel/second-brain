Many high performers have a ceiling problem.

That isâ€”they *don't have a ceiling*. They just keep working as many hours as possible. Their relationships suffer, their children don't see them, they lose on the enjoyment of life.

What's your number? Your amount of videos? Your amount of yes'es? What's the ceiling after which you can *stop and have fun*?

Maybe you don't call it being burned out...
Would you call it "having less fun"?
