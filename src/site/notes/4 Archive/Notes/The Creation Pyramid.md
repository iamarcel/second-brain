## Vision
You get energy from a positive or negative potential reality.

Write it down.
Refine often.
Make it as real as possible.

What is your ideal day?
What kind of person do you want as a significant other?
How do you want to look? Feel?
How much money do you want to make? Why? 
How do you want to act?

## Purpose
We will go through purposes, but find the **big** one.

What's the massive problem you want to solve in the world? What would you change if you could? (You can.)

Find where curiosities intersect with talents.

**The money you make is directly proportional to the solution you build for a big problem.**

## Values
Values are your life theme, code to live by, non-negotiables that keep you on the path.

## Goals
Goals are how you make conscious progress within the game of life. Quests in the storyline, checkpoints along the path.

**Goals are metrics for progress.**

**Goals need to be achievable. Not "realistic," as you are unaware of your true potential.**

Getting specific is necessary, but not to be dwelled on. Goals are guides. Your focus should be in the present, on the task at hand.

Set goals that align with the improvement of your health, wealth, and relationships according to your vision.

## Projects
These are structured, more understandable way of achieving your goals.

You will accelerate the creation process by building alongside your learning. Implement your learnings immediately.

The project must slightly exceed your skill level. This is what makes it a challenge, kicks you into flow, and what turns all of this into a fun game.

## Priorities
They give you something to focus and execute on. A reason to stop worrying about the unimportant external factors of life.

## Intention
The Why behind your actions. The reason behind aspects of your vision. Comes with experience.

## Action
Without action, everything is useless.
Make it so stupidly simple that you would look stupid for not doing it.

## Curiosity
The catalyst for everything else.

*Creation starts with curiosity.*

Sit down, pull out a notebook, and write down everything you would do if you had all of the free time in the world.

You may not realize it yet, but most of these can be pursued, turned into a business, and used to gain autonomy and have a meaningful impact on the world.

To further refine, consider potential utility. A good metric: someone else has already done what you want to do.

Schedule time to research these.

## Alignment
When all of these align in the present moment, you kick into flow.
