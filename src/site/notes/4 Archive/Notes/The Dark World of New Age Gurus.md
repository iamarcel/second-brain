People like [[Napoleon Hill\|Napoleon Hill]] have a very dubious past with a history of scams. But his book still provides some value to some people.

This is what [[New Age\|New Age]] does:
- Build trust by providing some value
- Attach more extreme ideas
- Blur the lines so people can't distinguish actual truth anymore

We cannot falsify new age thought. We cannot possibly quantify "amount of thoughts" to verify if you "visualized well."

The best grift is the one that leaves the grifter blameless.
