Fuck it we won't talk about the essential Eight, J realized during breathwork.

You think, you think you can't, you're absolutely right.

Where attention goes, energy flows.

**Doing the work is not embodying the work.**

You can do the work but if you're not *embodying* it, if you *are* not it, you're not doing it.

We should constantly check ourselves to make sure we're thinking as big as we should.

Crazy magical mystical things happen where you out your attention.

**Your body and your soul hear everything you say to them.**

The universe is always listening so why not ask for outrageous things?
