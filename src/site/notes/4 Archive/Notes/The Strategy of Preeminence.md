Strategy to catapult business success and multiply results. Preemptive business strategy to forge your activities around.

1. What is the strategy of preeminence?

"I'm not trying to sell you—I want to **serve** you."

2. How do you get preeminence in a market?

It's an integrated fabric, a strategic mindset.

Subordinate your needs and totally focus on the "other side"—the side of the client.

3. The primary basis for the entire preeminence strategy is based on a keen commitment to empathy

Be very respectful and understanding of how the "other side" in the transaction is feeling (hopes, dreams, needs).

MW: This is something I really should consider with every post—how would my audience feel when they see this? How do I want them to feel?

**Truly preeminent companies and individuals, in every communication, always sell *leadership*, a definitive belief system, authoritative positioning and a conviction of their point of view.** They communicate in everything they do and say, that they want to lead you to a greater yield, a greater result, a greater happiness or greater profit.

"I want to give you what you need, want and desire."

4. **There is a world of difference between giving information and giving helpful advice**

**Information is inconclusive.**
Giving helpful advice is definitive.
Good advice is converted into action.

Being specific is incredibly powerful: here's what you should do, here's how you should do it and here's why you should do it.

People want you to be the expert. Don't be afraid to take stance.

You cannot allow your customers to make a mistake because your success depends on their success.

5. It's your job to help provide focus

Focus is clarity.
- Most people don't know what's out of focus until someone shows them.
- Connect the dots for them. It helps them take the next step.

Clarity gives power.
- Customers have to define for themselves their biggest frustrations, challenges and opportunities. **In most cases, your customers are paralyzed because they cannot put their dreams into words, and they just have a vague idea of what they really want—so they can't take action.**
- Just asking this makes a change: what would the picture look like if your business were operating the way you really want it to?

Power gives understanding.
- Cultivate your ability to *put into words* what people want and build on that.
- **The first thing is to articulate the biggest, clearest desired result people abstractly felt but never had clarified for them.** Then build a strategy of action they can take, new concepts they had never recognized they wanted before.

Understanding gives certainty.
- Certainty: preeminence means *hopefulness*. Best wishes for every single prospect they come in contact with, better and higher wish or hopes than they even wanted for themselves.
- It is this hopefulness that gives their customers the courage, belief, strength and the desire to establish a long-term, loyal, lifelong relationship with that company.

Certainty gives trust.
- Always provide views that customers can absolutely trust. Never put your interest ahead of theirs.

Without trust, people won't take action.
- Most buyers base everything they do on absolute, authoritative leadership.
- People are silently thinking, "I don't know what to do," so they are searching for someone they trust, who understands their point of view and can point them in the right direction.
- People really are mad—they don't feel anyone is listening to what they really want.
- You should go to someone and say, **"I understand your frustration, and I think I can help. Here's what I perceive you really want, and I'd like you to tell me first if that's right or wrong. Once you and I agree that we both clearly and fully agree on your ultimate goals and dreams and wishes, then we can move forward with a plan to make them come true. And I think I can do that for you".**

6. The strategy of preeminence relies on authentic communications

Your message doesn't have value unless it makes an impact.

7. People buy for emotional benefits

Typically, great rewards are emotional, not tangible.

Logic doesn't make a sale. You have a solution to a problem they also feel emotionally.

People will avoid making decisions because they don't want to feel foolish.

You want to show how your product, service, friendship, partnership, doing business with you will make people feel good about themselves.

7. Six questions to ask

**A.** If I were on the receiving end, why would I want this?
**B.** Why would I want to take advantage of this offer at this particular time?
**C.** What's in it for me?
**D.** How will this product make me feel better about myself, my family, my business, my future, my life?
**E.** Why is this better than doing what I'm doing — or doing nothing at all?
**F.** So what?

Your promotion, your selling posture, your proposition has to answer a question that's already on a customer's mind. It has to provide a solution or a result that is big enough, tangible enough, and desirable enough that it will compel them to want to take action.

8. 12 words that will change your life forever

**Most people fall in love with their product instead of their prospect.** But that's the exact reverse of what needs to happen.

You should ask yourself, what benefit do I have to render?

The message you want to give: you matter. Your well-being is important to me.

9. Sell the end result, not the steps to get there

Don't say, I've been very successful and I'd like to work with you—say, let me show you what I do and how my system works so you can sign on.

**Most people don't want to see things as a process.** They would rather see it as a project with a beginning and an end.

People need solutions not strategy. Someone to advocate their well-being.

Never be afraid to ask your current customers, is there a better way?

11. "Show me" is more powerful than "tell me"

12. Ways to make it easier for them

Reduce the height of the hurdles.
Talk about frustrations or desire they really feel.
People worry about whether they stand out, whether people will care—let them know you think they're special, let them know you care.
Don't make them buy less than they want.

13. Make the customer the center of attention
