# Notes
## Introduction
In our new world, a man’s presence—his depth of awareness—is his most valuable asset.

Your capacity to embody this profound force of presence in your gaze, breath, and action determines your perceived value, sexually and financially.

depth of being

This book is a guide for a specific kind of newly evolving man. This man is unabashedly masculine—he is purposeful, confident, and directed, sensitive, spontaneous, and spiritually alive, with a heart-commitment to discovering and living his deepest truth.

It was a good thing for men to embrace their feminine and women to embrace their masculine. But this 50/50 stage is only a second and intermediate stage of growth. Bank accounts are balancing while passions are fizzling out.

Sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity.

If you want real passion, you need a ravisher and a ravishee; otherwise, you just have two buddies who decide to rub genitals in bed.

If you have a masculine essence, you are driven by a sense of mission. You may not know your mission, but unless you discovery this deep purpose and live it fully, your life will feel empty at its core, even if youir intimate relationship and family life are full of love.

The feminine wants to be filled with love.

All people have both masculine and feminine qualities they could use in any moment, most have a more masculine or feminine core. About 90% of people have either a more masculine or more feminine sexual essence.

The Way of the Superior Man is a book written explicitly for people who have already achieved respect for other genders and sexual preferences, and who consider men and women to be social, economic and political equals.

## A Man’s Way
### Stop hoping for a completion of anything in life
Don’t do things “just for now until…” Things will not change.

As of now, spend a minimum of one hour a day doing whatever you are waiting to do until your finances are more secure, or the children have grown and left home, or until you have finished your obligations and you feel free to do what you really want to do.

Find out today whether you are willing to do what it takes to give your gift fully.

Don’t wait. Assume she’s going to be however she is, forever.

The feminine always seems chaotic and complicated from the perspective of the masculine.

Practice love instead of trying to fix your woman. You can’t escape the tussle with the feminine. Learn to find humor in the unending emotional drama the feminine seems to enjoy so much. The love that you magnify may realign her behavior, but your effort to fix her and your frustration never will.

### Live with an open heart even if it hurts
Chest and solar plexus becoming tense and contracted: these are signs of an unskillful reaction to hurt.

Open the front of your body. Look directly into the eyes of whomever you are with, feeling your own pain as well as the other person.

Feel the entire situation with your whole body.

### Live as if your father were dead
Love your father yet be free of his expectations—it’s the only way to be a free man.

### Know your real edge and don’t fake it
Your edge is where you stop short, or where you compromise your fullest gift, and, instead, cater to your fears.

The more a man is playing his *real* edge, the more valuable he is as good company for other men, the more he can be trusted to be authentic and fully present.

Some people are too connected with their fears. Their lives are relatively secure and comfortable, but dead. They lack the aliveness, the depth, and the inspirational energy that is the sign of a man living at his edge.

Live with your lips pressed against your fears, kissing your fears, neither pulling back nor aggressively violating them.

### Always hold on to your deepest realization
Make your life an ongoing process of being who you are.

Even if you find yourself in some trivial moment, watching TV or cleaning up a mess in the kitchen, feel the truth of who you are. Feel the boundless cognizance in which each instant seems and vanishes.

### Never change your mind just to please a woman
A man should consider her, but should never betray his own deepest knowledge and intuition in order to please his woman or “go along” with her.

**If you don’t trust your own wisdom, why should she trust it?**

If you give up your real decision to follow your woman’s, then you will blame her for being wrong if she is wrong, and you will feel disempowered if she is right, having denied yourself the opportunity to act from your core and grow from your mistakes.

### Your purpose must come before your relationship
Admit to yourself that if you had to choose one or the other, the perfect intimate relationship or achieving your highest purpose in life, you would choose to succeed at your purpose.

Your woman will be more fulfilled with thirty minutes a day of undivided attention and ravishing love than she will will with a few hours of your weak and divided presence when your heart really isn’'t into it. Time you spend with your woman should be time you really want to be with her more than anything else.

### Lean just beyond your edge
By leaning just beyond your fear, you challenge your limits compassionately, without trying ot escape the feeling of fear itself. You step beyond the solid ground of security with an open heart. You stand in the space of unknowingness, raw and awake. Here, the gravity of deep being will attend you to the only place where fear is obsolete: the eternal free fall of home. Where you always are.

### Do it for love
The way a man penetrates the world should be the same way he penetrates his woman: not merely for personal gain or pleasure, but to magnify love, openness, and depth.

A man must know the truth at his core and be willing to give his gifts fully.

You can ravish your woman so deeply that her surrender breaks your heart into light.

If you are going to tryst with women and world at all, better to go all the way and ravish them from the depths of your true core, blooming them open with the wide gifts of your unrelenting heart.

### Enjoy your friends’ criticism
About once a week, you should sit down with your closest men friends and discuss what you are doing in your life and what you are afraid of doing. Short and simple. Then your friends should give you a behavioral experiment, something you can do that will reveal something to you, or grant more freedom in your life. ^ab52dc

Good friends should not tolerate mediocrity in one another.

The father force is the force of loving challenge and guidance.

### If you don’t know your purpose, discover it, now
The core of your life is your purpose.

The superior man is not seeking for fulfillment through work and woman, because he is already full. For him, work and intimazy are opportunities to give his gifts, and be vanished in the bliss of giving.

### Be willing to change everything in your life
Cycles of strong specific action followed by periods of not knowing what the hell is going on are natural for a man who is shedding layers of karma in his relaxation into truth.

If you open yourself to living af your edge, you will discover layer after layer of purpose. Each layer gets you to a deeper purpose.

Each purpose, each mission, is meant to be fully lived to the point where it becomes empty, boring and useless. Then it should be discarded.

You stay open to a vision of your deeper purpose bny not filling your time with distractions. Don’t watch TV or play computer games.

When one purpose is peeled, get to the next one and act fully, until that purpose, too, is dissolved in the bliss of the love that you are.

### Don’t use your family as an excuse
You cannot abnegate your deepest purpose to to things that transcend personal preferences in favor of the larger commitment.

Self-resignation communicates itself to your woman. They will feel your weakness. She will begin to take charge—someone has to do it and you’re not capable.

**The priority of the feminine is the flow of love in the relationship.** The priority of the man is freedom.

Ultimately, true freedom and true love are the same. However, the joyrney of the masculine and feminine to this unity of love and freedom is very different.

It is not the amount of time but the quality of the interaction that most influences a child’s growth. Children are exquisitely sensitive to emotional tone. If you are not full in your core, aligned with your deepest purpose and living a life of authentic commitment, your children will feel it.

### Don’t get lost in tasks and duties
Whatever the specifics of a man’s purpose, he must always refresh the transcendental element of life through regular meditation and retreat.

The test of your fullness in every moment is your capacity to die in free and loving surrender, knowing you’ve done everything you could do while alive to give your gift and know the truth of being.

Do you consistently relax into the awe of immense mystery?

### Stop hoping for your woman to get easier
Her desire is for his deepest truth and love. As he grows, so will her testing.

**Every moment of your life is either a test or a celebration.**

The most erotic moment for a woman is feeling that you are Shiva, the divine masuline: unperturbable, totally loving, fully present, and all-pervading.

If you are free and loving, nothing she says can collapse you.

You don’t need your woman’s strokes. It still feels good when she strokes you. But you dno’t need mommy anymore, telling you what a good boy you are. And your woman doesn’t want you to need mommy. In fact, it sickens her.

A good woman will love the childlike part of you, but she wants your life ot be guided by your deepest truths, not your untended childhood wounds.

So she will test you. She will poke your weak spots, especially in moments of your superficial success, in order to feel your strength.

You don’t need her validation in order for you to be loving. You simply *are loving*.

A woman will always test her man for the pleasure of feeling his strength in loving, his capacity to transcend nuisance, his persistence in his own truth.

## Dealing with women

### Women are not liars
What she says is often more a reflection of a transient feeling-wave than a well-considered stance with respect to events and experience.

When you listen to your woman, listen to her as you would the ocean, or the wind in the leaves.

For the feminine, truth is a thin concept compared to the thickness of her flow of feelings.

Don’t believe the literal content of what your woman says unless love is flowing deeply and fully in the moment when she says it.

### Praise her
The masculine grows by challenge, but the feminine grows by praise.

Telling her, “I love the shape of your body,” will be much greater incentive for her to exercise than telling her, “I hope you don’t gain any more weight.”

If you want your woman to grow in her radiance, health, happiness, love, beauty, power, and depth, praise these qualities. Praise them daily, a number of times. Praise the very qualities that you feel are not yet praiseworthy in order for them to become so.

### Tolerate her leads to resenting her
It is not entirely her fault that she is bitchy and complaining—it is also a reflection of her lack of being penetrated by love.

Intimacy is about growing more than you could by yourself, through the art of mutual gifting.

One of the largest gifts you can give your woman is your capacity to open her heart when it is closed. Sure, she can get herself out of her dark mood, but your masculine thunderbolt of love can brighten her darkness in a way she can’t do for herself.

### Don’t analyze your woman
90 percent of a woman’s emotional problems stem from feeling unloved.

### Don’t suggest that a woman fix her own emotional problem
What she really wants is a man who can figure it out for himself. She wants a man who loves her, and escorts her with his loving, without having to ask her what she wants all the time.

One of the deepest feminine desires in intimacy is to be able to relax and surrender.

### Stay with her intensity---to a point
When a woman gets emotionally intense, a mediocre man wants to calm her down and discuss it, or leave and come back later when she is "sane." A superior man penetrates her mood with imperturbable love and unwavering consciousness. If she still refuses to live more fully in love, after a time, he lets her go.

**You can learn to master the world by learning how to be free and loving in the chaos of your woman's emotions.** You do that by standing your ground and loving so strongly that only love prevails. Like wrestling a steer or surfing ocean waves, mastery involves blending with your woman's powerful energy and feeling the rise and fall of the moment, without lapsing in presence for a second.

### Don't force the feminine to make decisions
If a man expects his woman to always make her own decisions and be accountable for the results, he is withholding his masculine gift. She will cease surrendering in love with him, cease trusting his masculine capacity, and, instead become her own man.

Often her feminine feelings will be a much better basis for a decision than your masculine analysis. So, encourage her to feel into the situation and trust her feelings. But, for the sake of polarity and happiness in intimacy, always tell her what you would do and why, even if you think she should make her own decision.


## Part Three: Working With Polarity And Energy

### Your attraction to the feminine is inevitable
Masculine men are attracted to forms of feminine energy: radiant women, beer, music, nature, etc.

If you feel uncomfortable with your attraction to women, you are probably uncomfortable with your own masculine essence. Your attraction to women, all kinds of women, is natural, normal and beautiful. **All desire is an aspect of your native impulse to give love.**

The desire she arouses is a blessing in itself, acting on it and pursuing her is another matter entirely. Let her waves of feminine energy move through your body like a deep massage.

### Choose a woman who is your complementary opposite
For instance, a more masculine man can expect that any woman who really turns him on and enlivens him will also be relatively wild, undisciplined, "bonkers," chaotic, prone to changing her mind and "lying." Still, from an energetic perspective, this kind of woman will be much more healing and inspiring to him than a more balanced or neutral woman who is steady, reasonable, "trustworthy," and able to say what she means in a way he can understand.

The false neutralization, or depolarization, of relationships is one of the main reasons that couples break up.

The feminine is an infinite source of love, inspiration, and power, both physically and spiritually. Feminine women are connected with the elements of nature in ways that more masculine people, such as yourself, usually aren't. Feminine women may seem wild, untrustable, or even irresponsible from a man's perspective, but such women are simply free of the **masculine need to live in a world governed by reason and control**.

You can learn to be turned on by her dance or anger as much as by her slinky purr.

### Know what is important in your woman
The feminine is the force of life.

### You will often want more than one woman
He should know that there is no way to avoid such desires. He should also know that acting on such desires, through temporarily enlivening and exhilarating, often ends up complicating his life far more than the occasion itself is worth.

Self-discipline is when your highest desires rule your lesser desires, not through resistance, but through loving action grounded in understanding and compassion.

How many women you have sex with is your business. Before you consider more than one, however, it is best to prove your capacity with one. If you can't handle one---if deep communion, rejuvenating passion, and spiritual happiness are not the main features of your present intimacy---then you have not passed the test, and it is best to discipline your desire for other partners, since nobody is likely to be served.

### Young women offer you a special energy
Just sitting next to a young woman can make you happy and fill you with life force. Uncompromised, youthful, feminine energy turns you on and opens your heart.

Our culture reduces this youthful energy to a sexual thing, whereas it is actually a whole-body transmission of energy, affecting the heart as much as or more than the genitals.

Relax your body and allow your heart to open in her presence. Allow love to radiate from your heart toward her. Maintain a respectful formality so that she is free and empowered to give her gift.

### Each woman has a "temperature" that can heal or irritate you
This is the difference between a woman who is cool and soothing and a woman who is hot and exciting.

Your needs for feminine energy change. You can change your diet to a more cooling diet or keep your body cooler. You could get a professional massage, for instance, from a woman with cooling energy.

Don't confuse your energy needs with a commitment in love, though.


## Part Four: What Women Really Want

### Choose a woman who chooses you
If a man wants a woman who doesn't want him, he cannot win. His neediness will undermine any possible relationship, and his woman will never be able to trust him. A man must determine whether a woman really wants him but is playing hard to get, or whether she really doesn't want him. If she doesn't want him, he should immediately cease pursuing her and deal with his pain by himself.

Once she feels your neediness, she will never trust your masculine core. The priority of the masculine core is mission, purpose, or direction in life. The priority of the feminine core is the flow of love in intimacy. If she feels that the intimacy is more important to you than to her, she will naturally animate her masculine.

You are only punishing yourself when you want to be in a relationship with a woman more than she wants to be in a relationship with you.

### What she wants is not what she says
**Sometimes a woman will make a request of her man in plain English, not to get him to do something, but to see if he is so weak that he will do it.**

Her trust is engendered not only by him fulfilling her request, but by him magnifying love, consciousness, and success in their lives, in spite of her requests.

Story example: he knew that ejaculating had not been the right thing to do in the moment, but he had succumbed to his wife's wish.

She would rather try to distract you from your truth, and then feel that she cannot---that you hold fast to your truth while you continue to love her.

The divine masculine is consciousness. A superior man practices maintaining full consciousness in all situations. If ejaculation results in a decrease of your fullness, a diminution of your presence, a collapse of your consciousness, then you should not ejaculate. Even if your woman says she wants you to. *Especially* when your woman says she wants you to.

**Know that your woman is always pleased most by your strength in love, freedom and consciousness.**

### Her Complaint is Content-Free
Women are always wanting divine masculine presence in a man, regardless of their specific complaint or mood.

A man should hear his woman's complaints like warning bells, and then do his best to align his life with his truth and purpose.

The content of her complaint reflects more her present mood and serves as a reminder to "get it together." It is a mistake to believe the content of what she's saying and respond to her complaints, point by point.

Your word is a demonstration of your purpose, your masculine core. If you don't follow through over time she will begin to build her own masculine protection against your lack of integrity.

At the level of polarity, you're attracted to and enlivened by her feminine radiance. Likewise, she is by your masculine clarity, direction, integrity, and presence. Don't make her compensate for your failure.

### She Doesn't Really Want to Be Number One
If she is number one, she will feel he is not fully dedicated or directed to divine growth and service. **She will feel her man's dependence on her** for his happiness. A woman really wants her man to be totally dedicated to his highest purpose—and also to love her fully.

Although she seems to want to be the most important thing in your life, she can trust and love you more if she is not.

**You have a gift to give, a purpose to fulfill, a deep heart-impulse that moves you.**

Though she might not always like your choices, she will *love* them, and she will love you for having the courage to live your truth.

### Your Excellent Track Record is Meaningless To Her
The feminine responds to the moment of energy, forgetting her man's history of past behavior.

Don't get upset. Instantly shift the energy between you. Assume happiness. Shock her with your love. Surprise her in some loving way, and the emotional slate will be wiped clean.

### She Wants to Relax in the Demonstration of Your Direction
A woman must be able to trust you to take charge if she relaxes her own masculine edge.

She won't be able to relax if she has to take charge, if you are unable. You must relieve her of the necessity to be in charge. Not boss her around, but you need to know where you're heading and how you're going to get there, in every way, including financially and spiritually.

She will feel the slightest uncertainty or ambiguity.

Even more important is knowing the spiritual direction in your relationship. If you're totally absorbed in work she'll think "is this it?" Her felt lack in financial or spiritual clarity will make her unable to relax.

You become more responsible by knowing your deepest purpose, and then arranging your finances and spiritual life from that knowingness.


## Part Five: Your Dark Side

### You Are Always Searching for Freedom
The essential masculine ecstasy is in the moment of release from constraint, into freedom. The feminine often doesn't understand these masculine ways and needs.

Most sports are ritualized war.

The attachment to comfort and security is what limits most men in their capacity to make a spiritual touchdown. To be free is to die to your need to be a separate self.

A woman's bliss is not in emptiness, but in fullness. Her means is not release, but surrender. She longs to fill her sense of spiritual emptiness by surrendering her heart and being filled with love.

The essential masculine fear is the loss of self—which is also the essential masculine desire.

### Own Your Darkest Desires
If a man disowns his dark masculine desire for freedom, then he kinks the host of his masculine force.

When was the last time you really ravished your woman? That is, when was the last time you really "took" her, savagely, lovingly, with no inhibition whatsoever? Or, has it been so long that you are fascinated and even turned on by rape scenes on TV or in the movies?

The desire to ravish is the sexual of the same masculine desire that wants to break through opponents in sports, philosophical barriers to insight, and fear of death into spiritual freedom.

The dark feminine desire, to be forced to surrender, is as strong as the dark masculine desire to penetrate through a woman's resistance. The difference between rape and ravishment is love.

You must learn to let go, absolutely, in love with your woman. Allow this love to ravish your woman to busting, filling her heart and body beyond capacity, so she has no choice but to surrender to the depth and force of your loving.

### She Wants The 'Killer' In You
The dark masculine energy of the warrior, the one who could face death and kill when necessary, is an essential part of you.

Beneath the nice veneer of most women lies the wrathful goddess who would chop the head off of every mediocre "new age" man.

She wants to feel your persistence in loving, so that her fury cannot turn you away.

Your woman's desire for your dark side, in love, is a gift to you.

### She Needs Your Consciousness to Match Her Energy
The goddess of devotion muse be met by the god of all-pervading love. Dark or light, a man can't be stuck in, or avoid, any areas of his masculine capacity or his woman will test him there. She will keep returning to the energy that you cannot match.

**She wants your consciousness—clear, strong, and free—as much as you want her radiance.**

The secret is to match her energy with consciousness *demonstrated through your body*. Your body, tone of voice, and the look in your eyes mean a lot more to her than anything you could say. Don't tell her what to do, but do it with her, with your body. If she's tense and closed down, lift her arms up above her head and kiss her heart.

She will never trust your "lighter" masculine capacities until you have proven your "darker" masculine capacities. She knows that if you are not free to meet her dark destructress energy and ravish her in love, you won't be free to meet  the dark destructress of the world—who will challenge your spiritual freedom—with strength and love.

You need not concern yourself with pleasing her. That's not the point. Her gift, if she is a good woman, is to test you with her darkest moods, over and over and over, until your consciousness is unperturbed by feminine challenge, and you are able to pervade her with your love, just as you are here to pervade the world.


## Part Six: Feminine Attractiveness

### The Feminine is Abundant
Life itself is the feminine. There is never a shortage of feminine energy, only a resistance to receiving, trusting, and embracing it.

Whenever you are feeling isolated and weary, feel the present moment as if it were a woman.

Relax your body and feel the ocean of feminine energy around you. Feel your surroundings as her form, the sounds around you as her moans and laughter, and the light around you as her smile. Actually relax with the moment as you would relax with your lover, not metaphorically but literally, bodily, with full intention and presence.
