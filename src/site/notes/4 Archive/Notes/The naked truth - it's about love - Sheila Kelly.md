**Erotic energy is such a natural energy like hunger.** It literally moves your cells to be a tiddly thing.

**Erotic energy is not for the bedroom. It is for everywhere.**

It creates an energy where you cannot escape each other's vortex.

Your body is more brilliant than you are.

Being in sync improved everything. My energy, my mothering skills, my business skills, all because I got in touch with my essence.

To get to a free body.

**We want your attention all the fucking time but if you do it we lose respect for you.**

Fix the feminine, fix the culture.

Men have rationality which is emotion but they know a way of funneling it into doing something about it.

What gets shut down the hardest
- curve of movement
- sensuality
- Emote-ability

We just need to shut up and listen to the body.

Emote-ability: emotions shape you. We have thousands of words for them but they boil down to 10 emotions.

I speak body before I speak words.

This is *body* emotion. I believe all mammals have this.

Your erotic creature essence is composed of one of these emotions.

In it's bad side the joyful playmate tells all the other energies to shut up.

I practice the ones that are weaker so I can get full expression in my body.

You usually have 3 personas in daily life and 3 sensual.

Shy reluctant enigma: the feminine wants to be exposed, the masculine not necessarily.

MW everyday essence: joyful playmate, provocateur, 
MW protector? Champion?
MW erotic essence: lover? playmate?

It's important to know how the other essence lives their lives.

It's a crime to nature to never have expressed your true essence.

Once you taste the nectar of your genius, nothing is going to stop you from it.

MW Exercise partner. Jacoba. Everyday deep soulful; erotic lustful lover?

**Meditating is a masculine energy.**

For the feminine you cannot think your way into it.

You can't figure this out. It comes through awareness.

Ask people who know you. There's a test on her website.

**If I can't distract him we know he's a provider. We want you to go fucking kill the world.**

If they're scary we feel safe too.

That kind of focus? He will take over the world. With feminine energy backing him up.
