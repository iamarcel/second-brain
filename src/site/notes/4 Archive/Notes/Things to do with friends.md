In real life or in a movie, watch the people and make up stories about their lives.

Have fun and ponder where these stories come from in your own. What beliefs, previous experiences do these come from?

About once a week, you should sit down with your closest men friends and discuss what you are doing in your life and what you are afraid of doing. Short and simple. Then your friends should give you a behavioral experiment, something you can do that will reveal something to you, or grant more freedom in your life.
