# Once upon a time

```typescript
const oneDay = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
const oneWeek = oneDay * 7;

const oneWeekFromNow = new Date(
  Date.now() + oneWeek
);
```

# wat

```typescript
const start = new Date(2022, 2, 25);

);

...and we're not even talking about different time zones, or when we *do* care about time.

## Everything is UTC

Demo: picking a UTC date in different time zones

---

### What could possibly go wrong?
- Britain starts DST earlier
- Southern hemisphere DST is swapped
- Samoa skipped December 30, 2011
- Countries change timezone quite often
- Libya cancelled DST in 2013
- Britain: until 16th century New years was on March 25th
- West Bank: time zone depends on political affiliation
- Leap seconds

## Two Realizations

Clock time â‰  moment in time. *This is not a timestamp.*

Length of second/day/month/year depends on time zone.

---

## oh btw

every country wants a different date format

12h / 24h

month first / day first

is a comma really a comma?

plurals?

currencies?

---

Do I really have to do this?

## Java

```java
java.util.Date; // bad
java.time.* // good
```

[The Date Time API Overview - dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/date-time/intro/) often forces you to think before you do stupid things.

- Instant: Storage
- LocalDateTime: When only "wall clock" time counts
- OffsetDateTime: Okay for single point in time
- ZonedDateTime: For correct calculations

---

## JavaScript

`Date` is being replaced by `Temporal`. Similar API to the Java one.

Basically: show it in the right format and zone. Angular mostly takes care of this.

[Angular's Pipes](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-common-format-data-locale)
- DatePipe
- CurrencyPipe
- DecimalPipe
- PercentPipe

Angular locale data is not always correct ðŸ˜­

---

# Localization in the browser
Locale negotiation.

Locale â‰  Language.

---

## Plain JavaScript: Intl

[Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)
- Locale
- [DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) (nl-NL vs nl-BE)
- [NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat)
- PluralRules
- RelativeTimeFormat

---

## Angular: LOCALE_ID

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import '@angular/common/locales/global/en';  
import '@angular/common/locales/global/nl';

providers: [
  { provide: LOCALE_ID, useValue: 'nl-BE' },
]
```

Or `useFactory: () => navigator.language`.

Or do your own negotiation.

# Conclusions

- Use the built-in packages, Luke
- Care about time
- Calculate time only with a zone
- Use `Intl` to format numbers, dates, plurals
