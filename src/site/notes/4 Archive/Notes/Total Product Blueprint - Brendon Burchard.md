A modern thought leader business only comes from email.

You should be able to leverage it all week long.

4x daily posts.
Save and recycle posts.

### Funnel sequence
[[4 Archive/Notes/OVO\|OVO]]
Start with 1 funnel and add more.

### Reporting
Think as a manager of a business. You have to know how things are working.

## Offer Set
Make sure you have a modern offer set.
Re-shoot old videos (at least the sales process).
Subscription / continuity / membership is an incredible thing to sell. If you know what your income is going to be, you can make a budget.
