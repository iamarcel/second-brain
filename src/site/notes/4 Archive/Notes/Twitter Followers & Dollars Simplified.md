# Course Notes

## Intro
- Part 1: get followers
	- Use these until 2500 followers
	- Only after that following create products for them
- Part 2: money

Mindset:
- You’ll have to deal with trolls
- Keep a consistent character
- Use *Block* a lot—just block anyone you don’t want to see your content
- This will be a transformative experience for you
- You will need to be kind and supportive—even when you don’t want to
- It will fuck with you emotionally at the start. Most people quit because they can’t handle Twitter emotionally.

If you stay consistent, you wil be rewarded in many many ways.

## Setting Up & Optimizing Your Profile
### Images
Profile picture should be clear and eye-catching.

If you look like a regular person that isn’t providing value or trying to grow their Twitter, they won’t click.

Anonymous vs. regular doesn’t matter; complex header image doesn’t matter.

### Bio & Pinned
No need to overthink, but some good ideas.
Poor tweet quality can be dealt with with a good bio.

Put your own personal transformation journey into words.
USP structure: I help X do Y (with/without Z).

### Niche
You can get stuck if you put yourself in a too little of a box.

*You* are a niche. What you tweet and how you talk curates your audience.

**Being yourself + having a traditional niche = successful combo for growth.**

Keep things relatively broad in your profile.

I’ve read 10 self-improvement books, I like reading articles and going to the gym—that definitely sets me apart from a lot of people. As common as it is to some people, it’s definitely not what the majority do.

Be a person that stands out, provide good content, and you’ll grow.
## Getting Followers Without Writing Tweets

### Replies
This is extremely important for accounts that are just starting out.

Write a tweet-worthy reply—people can retweet that too.

Only troll and have fun if you know people will take it the right way.

Respond to people in a timely manner, once you have 2-3K followers. The reply gives your post a little boost, so don’t do it *immediately* after posting.

**Create a daily reply goal and prioritize it over everything.**

Retweet with comment to add value to your audience, or to get a RT from a big account. (Don’t prioritize RT with comment on a big account. Learn how to write first.)

If you’re a bit of a bigger account, retweet smaller followers. It gives them a dopamine hit and bonds them to your content more.

Write something insightful that’s tweet-worthy on its own.

Twitter is not about writing the most insightful tweets. It’s about creating a community of people you love and who love to read your stuff, then build each other up.

#### Homework
- Time block 20-30 minutes over 1-2 blocks
- Set a reply goal of 20 replies per day
- Be insightful, joke around, be a great person, make friends
- RT with comment if you want to
- Find out what’s working and double down on that

## Write tweets for maximum engagement
Consume more quality. Subscribe to blogs, read books, listen to podcasts, relevant to what you want to tweet.

In order to win at Twitter you don’t need to be an expert, but you need to present yourself as one.

Teach as you learn.

Spaced-out, easy to read tweets.

### Classic Tweet Structures
2x3: two times three bullet points. Can be used to explain or create contrast.

Listicle with heavy hitter. A list, then tie up everyting in a really good sentence.

Long *numbered* listicle (e.g., 5 things…). A great way to keep people reading.

Heavy hitting 1-liners.

Eye catcher. “Hard pill to swallow” / “unpopular opinion” / “popular opinion” / …

The slant: list where each line is longer. It looks a lot better. You should always have a sentence at the end that wraps things up.

Comparisons, metaphors, analogies.

Topic based lists.

Tell people what they NEED.

Personal tips + absolute. People love absolutes.

Your tweets can be extremely insightful + dumb it down.

Use the word “you” as much as possible. Use “don’t” and “stop.” People respond well when you do that and back it up.

People love to be told what to do and what not to do.

The tweet you were least expecting to go viral, is the one that will go viral. So don’t stick too hard to these structures.

Dan’s most popular topics:
- Monk mode / focus
- Anything money related
- Doing things a bit over the top
- Basic things people know they should do
- Targetic a specific age group
- Tips on improving your quality of life

Tips:
- Capture ideas as they come in
- People love stories
- **Confidence**
- Do bing things that make you an expert
- Be a human in replies and DMs
- Exaggerate your ideas

### Tweet Frequency
If you don’t have an audience, nobody is going to engage. Write 2-3 high quality tweets and engage a tonn.

As you grow, up your tweet frequency to 5-7 a day.

When starting out, you need to get into the flow of writing tweets.

Trust me, if you stay consistent with this you’ll get better. It’ll become second-nature.

Start writing and engaging immediately.

## Tweets that almost guarantee followers: Threads
Thread engage much more and people *commit* to reading what you have to say.

Ideas don’t come out of thin air—everything is a remix.

You can recycle threads into their own topics.

Example: case study thread on big accounts. Some of their tweets, with commentary, plus how you implemented and how yor life changed.

Inspiration threads.

Follow lists are fairly annoying but they get some retweets.

Make it seem like you did a lot of work. Put in a lot of work.

## Advanced Growth Tactics

### Networking

**Everyone on Twitter is a human being.** You *have* to understand this. Reach out to like-minded people. Act like a human being. Treat them as a friend, talk to them as yhou would someone over text—this creates relief and friendships. You can talk to them in a DM.

If you lost your account, would anyone help you build it up again?

Have fun on this journey that isn’t that serious. It’s just a fun way of building a business.

If you come to the realization that this is true, shoot me a DM and tell me how it went.o

### Structured Engagement Groups
Make friends, set up a group where you all like and engage with each others’ **best performing tweets**.

Have 7 people max, assign 2-3 days per week to send tweets. Create Excel and guarantee retweets.

These engagement groups are what grew my Twitter. This is a game changer.

Build 1-2-3 small communities of Twitter homies.

### Trade RTs
Find a friend with a similar follower count, ask them if they want to trade 1 RT per day.

Send your highest-performing tweet per day.

Works best when both of you have an audience. Give them tips on what has been working for you.

**Connections and relationships are the most important part of growing on Twitter.**

This guarantees retweets.

### Unlock more power as you grow
As you grow, you’ll make more friends. You’ll have more support, RTs, shoutouts, and love.

If your follower growth has slowed down, connect. Get into DMs, engage with people, build friends.

### Paid RTs
They’re not a bad thing. Should be consider shoutouts. They give tweets more traffic.

If you have a solid product or affiliate offer, you should be able to make this money back while growing.

You need to be good at writing tweets first.

You could technically make your own paid RTs by replying with engaging tweets on others’ tweets.

### Recycling best tweets
Twitter Analytics > Tweets > Top Tweets.

Use the *structure* and *topic* of these tweets to almost guarantee a high-engaging tweet. You can do this with all of your tweets.

Feel free to copy-paste your best tweets.

### Refining and Optimizing
Not seeing results? Check Twitter Analytics.

More polarization & absolutes probably increases follows for a tweet.

**The metric that counts is *Profile Clicks***

I have 3 post times early in the morning where they’re scheduled even before I’m awake because then they seem to work better.

You don’t want your post times to be at the same time as others in your feed.

## Homework
- Create a unique + optimized profile. Avoid what the majority is doing. Make it human and personal, don’t fall into the trap of what you think will help.
- Start with 2-3 high quality tweets a day.
- Engage 10-20 times per day.
- Bump numbers up once you are comfortable.
- Write thread of your own + as inspiration from big accounts.
- Start connecting with others that are trying to grow.
- Form groups of friends and help each other grow.
- Stay consistant — your writing tweets replies will improve once you know what is working.

## Part 2 - How to make $10K From Twitter
First focus solely on building audience. The money can come later.

## Mindset
You will go through hard times…guaranteed.

This is not at all like a 9-5 job or part-time job. Sales can be far and between. You won’t make every sale. You won’t see big results until a long time.

Only pay attention to others when their success fires you up.

Results might not be as immediate as you think they will be.

If bad results stay happening, you need to change something. Online business is all about iteration.

You will lose followers when you promote.

## Foundations of Online Business

### Products, Services, Targeted Traffic
Treat Twitter as a traffic source—you can’t earn from views like on YouTube.

The more niched down your audience is, the better you can promote products/services.

### Traffic Source
Twitter is a part of your funnel—you don’t need to sell directly from Twitter.

You can drive traffic to a blog, email list, YouTube video etc.

Focus on building an audience and directing them to relevant places.

### You need basic understanding of
- Marketing in general
- Copyrwiting for product/service langing pages
- Email marketing
- Web design for blog/landing pages
- Offer creation

## Creating an Offer
An offer is what makes you stand out from the crowd. (It’s not a product or service.)

Offer = combo of product/service, problems solved, and the value you’re exchanging for the price.

A great way to create an offer is **looking at others’ offers that are already selling and build off of those.**

### What makes a good offer?
- Pricing; pain of problem VS value of offer. (This is what coaches do: present offer in valuable way compared to their problems) free, low ticket, membership, high ticket, payment plans, etc.
- Risk reversal; money back guarantee, split payment, free trial, etc. (be creative)
- Discounts
- Bonuses

- What will you call your offer? Make big claims.
- What are you promising?
- Benefits over features; double points for emotions
- What will make your customer act NOW?

### The Value Ladder
You need to start at the bottom.

- The Great Giveaway
	- Free ebook
	- Free email course
	- Free webinar
	- Book, etc.
- Front-end offer
	- Low-cost ebook, course etc.
- Membership community
- Medium ticket course ($150-$1000)
- High-ticket mentorship or service

People will pay $50 to fix a $50 problem. They will pay $5000 to fix a $5K problem.

**Your offer needs to be a proven solution to a big problem within your niche.**

Then you need a unique angle / selling proposution. You need to understand your competitors and provide an amazing solution to your audience.

## Affiliate Marketing Basics
It’s pretty simple. Promote in the same way as your own product or service.

Find products you actually want to buy. Only affiliate for bigger sellers so you’re sure they have a solid offer.

Buy, but to good use, affiliate for them, talk about your wins and successes.

You can seel through
- References in free guides
- Software tutorials
- References in your courses
- Blog posts
- Direct messages (**underrated**)
- Any other way you’d sell your product

## My Twitter Money Story
Build connections. Give out your products to your connections for raving reviews and status.

**Connect with them first.**

### Making thousands via hidden tactics: giving out an excellent free course
I gave out a free course that was meant to be free. It had affiliate links. It is *over the top good.*

Understand “what will people think of me?”

The secret is giving an immense amount of value. You’ll get value back.

Their email was in a sequence now which can sell higher-ticket offers.

**Even my free offers are good.**

## Promotions

**You are not selling a product/service, you are selling a *transformation.***

List benefits. Elicit emotional responses. Focus on story and transformation.

### Structure
- Attention-grabbing first line (e.g., question that elicits emotional response)
- Emotional pains related to their transformation
- Optional but effective: proof via screenshots / testimonials
- Clear CTA (just “click the link” helps)

### Promotional Tweet Scarcity
People post a lot on Twitter.

Scarcity + low ticket offer + Twitter = MONEY. Limited product discount or limited time frame discount + countdown. Add limited add-ons. Increase the price.

The countdown works.

If I’m counting down in the replies on Twitter, it bumps it up the timeline and gives it more traffic again.

Use these sparingsly. Use them too much and people will wait.

One promotional day a month is okay.

### Promo threads / replies
You can promote non-directly:
- When a tweet does well, plug a promotional tweet
- Write a thread based on offer’s topic and plug tweets in between or at the end

### Notes on TL Promos
They’re like retargeting, the more it passes their eyes the more likely they are to buy.
Promote shamelessly.
Create a promotion schedule to hold yourself accountable. Alternate hard/soft.
There will be times when you get 0 sales.

### DM’s: best place for sales
#### Inbound Leads
Someone asking a question in DM.
Answer questions, ask about goals.
Ask about struggles, and next steps to take.
“I think you’d get a lot of value out of (offer). Shall I send you a link?”
Plug your (low ticket) offer and rake in the gold.

Remember transformation/emotional response.

#### Outbound Prospecting
This is cold outreach.
Treat them like a friend.

Give a compliment and ask a question about what they do.
After they answer, transition to *inbound* steps.

It’s okay to be a human first for a few days. Create the connection.

## Client Acquisition on Twitter
The most important things people on Twitter skimp out on.

Land clients by getting them on a call instead of a low-ticket product.
Send them a qualifying application.
Get them on a sales call after.

*Focus on the transformation.*

Examples of high ticket services:
- Web design / landing page design
- Personal branding mentorships (you can charge a lot for this if you get to 10K / 20K; you can charge 1500, 4000 even 10K if your offer is good enough)
- Health / fitness coaching
- Copywriting for product landing pages
- Coaching / consult calls for whar you do
- Any service that’s relevant to what you do

Start off by charging $500 - $1500 minimum. Gain confidence and ruthlessly increase by the thousand.

Info products are good, but there’s so much more money to be made landing clients.

### Qualifying
You don’t want people who can’t afford it, and have a *deep and burning* desire. You need a questionnaire that weeds them out:

- What do you do for work?
- (If selling marketing service) What’s your current marketing budget?
- (If selling marketing service) How are sales going? What is your goal for sales?

…but don’t make the process *too* drawn out—there’s not much investment from them.

### Discovery Call
You’ll need to do this for outbound leads or if you know they don’t know much about your offer.

Here you just ask about their transformation, qualify and basically get them ready for the big boy sales call.

### Sales call framework

**You need to learn more about sales on your own.** Either invest in someone helping you, or get a course, or practice.

- Build rapport / greet
- Stay in control of the call
	- Set expectations
	- If they ask “what’s the price”—don’t give in, walk them through the framework. Pricing will come at the end, okay for you?
- Why did they get on a call?
- Where are they currently?
- Where do they want to be?
- What’s preventing them from getting there?
- Make it urgent (some act now incentive, e.g., incentive for doing it now)
- Position your service as a solution to hitting their goals
	- What’s going to happen if they don’t hit their goals

It’s not easy.

Research sales techniques and stay human.

Record the calls and go over your own recordings.

Create a landing page > questionnaire > schedule call.

## Homework
- Understand what your audience wants (difficult to do when you don’t have a large audience)

Please don’t be someone who does this course and doesn’t follow up and do the things.

**If you stick with Twitter long enough, I have no doubt you will stack cash to the roof.**
