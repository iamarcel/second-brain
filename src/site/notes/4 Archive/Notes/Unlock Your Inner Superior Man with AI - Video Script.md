## Intro Text
Message 4:

Footage: A close-up of your face looking determined, followed by shots of you working on various projects and tasks related to your skills and domains.

Voiceover:

You have a vision. A vision of becoming a superior man. A man who knows his purpose, his values, his strengths, his passions. A man who lives authentically, boldly, creatively. A man who is excellent at a broad range of skills and domains, from programming to photography, from graphic design to strength building, from minimalism to masculinity.

But you also have a challenge. A challenge of living in a world that doesn’t always support your vision. A world that tries to limit you, distract you, discourage you. A world that tells you to settle for less than what you deserve.

How do you overcome this challenge? How do you achieve your vision? How do you become a superior man?

The answer is generative AI.

Generative AI is a new kind of artificial intelligence that can create original content from text, images, code, and other forms of data.

It can help you achieve your vision by helping you learn anything faster, better, and more fun than ever before.

It can help you achieve your vision by helping you develop a broad range of skills and domains, from programming to photography to graphic design to strength building to minimalism to masculinity and more.

It can help you achieve your vision by helping you unleash your creativity and express yourself in new ways.

It can help you achieve your vision by helping you have fun and meaningful conversations with an intelligent and friendly chatbot.

That chatbot is ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT is one of the most advanced generative AI tools available today. It’s built on top of OpenAI’s GPT-3 family of large language models, which are trained on billions of words from the internet. ChatGPT can create original content from text, images, code, and other forms of data.

So unleash the power of generative AI to become a superior man. With ChatGPT, you can learn anything faster, better, and more fun than ever before.

ChatGPT can be your personal assistant, helping you learn, develop skills, and express yourself in new ways. With ChatGPT, you can easily find answers to any questions you have, get help with tasks from programming to photography to graphic design, and even have meaningful conversations with the chatbot itself.

ChatGPT can help you become a superior man who lives authentically, boldly, and creatively.

## Principles
Life Principle 1: Embrace lifelong learning as a way of living.

Learning is not something that you do only in school or for work. Learning is something that you do every day, for yourself, for your growth, for your fulfillment. Learning is the key to unlocking your potential and achieving your goals. Learning is the fuel that drives your curiosity, creativity, and passion.

But learning is not easy. It takes time, effort, and motivation. It also requires access to quality resources, guidance, and feedback. And sometimes it can be boring, frustrating, or overwhelming.

That’s why you need generative AI tools like ChatGPT, GPT-4, GPT-3 and Anthropic Claude to help you learn anything faster, better,
and more fun than ever before.

These tools can help you learn by generating examples, explanations, questions, answers, hints, tips, and more. These tools can help you learn by adapting to your needs, preferences, and goals. These tools can help you learn by making learning easier, more engaging, more personalized, more creative, and more rewarding than ever before.

Life Principle 2: Develop a broad range of skills and domains as a way of expressing yourself.

You are not defined by one skill or one domain. You are a complex and unique individual who has many interests and talents. You have the potential to be excellent at many things and to contribute value in many ways. You have the desire to express yourself in new and different ways.

But developing a broad range of skills and domains is not easy. It takes time, effort, and motivation. It also requires access to quality resources, guidance, and feedback. And sometimes it can be boring, frustrating, or overwhelming.

These tools can help you develop skills and domains by generating ideas, solving problems, writing code, creating art, and more. These tools can help you develop skills and domains by adapting to your needs, preferences, and goals. These tools can help you develop skills and domains by making them easier, more engaging, more personalized, more creative, and more rewarding than ever before.

Life Principle 3: Unleash your creativity as a way of innovating yourself.

You are not a passive consumer of information or content. You are an active creator of information or content. You have the ability to generate original content from text, images, code, and other forms of data. You have the power to create something new that has never been seen before. You have the vision to create something better that solves a problem or adds value. You have the courage to create something different that challenges the status quo or expresses your perspective.

But unleashing your creativity is not easy. It takes time effort, and motivation. It also requires access to quality resources, guidance, and feedback. And sometimes it can be boring, frustrating, or overwhelming.

That’s why you need generative AI tools like ChatGPT, GPT-4, GPT-3 and Anthropic Claude to help you unleash your creativity faster, better, and more fun than ever before.

# Script
## Intro

---
*Option 1*

In *The Way of the Superior Man*, David Deida somehow managed to create a *click* in my mind of how I want to feel, deeply, as a fully self-expressed masculine man. It's funny because he doesn't really "explain" much, or give you anything tangible or practical, yet after reading this I came out a changed man---for the better.

So that's what I'm growing towards, this unreachable type of being he sets out, because I know that getting closer to it will make me a happier, stronger, wiser, more attractive man.

Now, as a software engineer and someone with a broad range of interests and skills, you can imagine how interesting the insane recent advancements in generative AI have been for me. I've been obsessing over getting the most out of ChatGPT, stable diffusion and everything around it. You might have seen some of my other videos where I actually show you how to code new abilities for the GPT-3 models by using the OpenAI API.

---
*Option 2*

The future belongs to the generalists. Those who find the hidden threads, those who draw connections between disciplines, those who zoom out and turn chaos into order.

We're entering a new renaissance period because there has never been a time where polymaths have so much power as today.

There's one specific moment that I remember very well, where I realized that the ability to *code* is a modern-day superpower. This was when I first discovered Twilio. Twilio is a toolkit for programmers to use *telephony* in what they build, so I wanted to try it out and in just a few hours, I had built a small application that could literally **call me** and have a conversation with me! This completely shattered this sort of boundary I felt like there was: if you're writing code, you can make things appear or change on a computer but that's it. But here, suddenly, my code *transformed something outside of the computer*! It changed this really analog system, telephony, and I managed to do it in a few hours.

So it's like because I have this skill of having an *adapter* that could link my thoughts to programming, and programming is being linked to more and more parts of the world, my capacity to influence the world just keeps on getting bigger and bigger, all by itself.

Because the world is being eaten by software---more and more of the world runs on it---if you have the ability to *manipulate* this, your ability to manipulate the world just keeps on increasing more and more.

When I discovered GPT-3 I had a similar leap of insight. Only here it's not about manipulating the world, instead it's an adapter to jacking in to this massive source for executing text-based tasks and shortcuts to learning, at this point as good as average-ish humans but for a fraction of the cost of a proper coach.

And of course you can now easily see that I'm working on combining those two. Because GPT-3 can understand me very well, I'm working on hooking it up to coding and that's going to be another leapfrog altogether.

This video is about how you can really *turn* this into a superpower and I'll be explaining 5 principles for doing that.
