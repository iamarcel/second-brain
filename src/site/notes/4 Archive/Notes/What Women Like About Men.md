My dad used to put all of his comforts, needs and desires aside so that his family could sustain itself. So I think masculinity has such beautiful properties in wanting to protect the feminine. Wanting to take care, to be generous.

In men there's this very stable security and like a strength, protection and forward movement and encouragement. What that feels like if you pair it all together is this incredible containment. So what it feels like when a man is really in his power is like: he creates this safe space or container in the world that allows me to feel kind of like a blossoming flower, allows me to feel this receptivity. Without a man in your world it feels like you need to tense up to survive on this world and become something you're not. When I feel at my best and most productive is when I feel this containment, without I feel more anxious and not as much energy.

Power, fearlessness. That you can just surrender and be.

They are beautiful in a way that complements me.

I don't think men should be looking for masculinity specifically. What I want men to do is to look for their own unique authenticity. It's a natural thing once he stops resisting himself, it is inevitable. And that the problem I thinkâ€”men think it's something out there they can emulate.

# Why men need women

Have you seen them? They make me a better version of myself. Without them I'd just be a mess floating around in the present.

I cannot control myself and woken can.

I need women for balance. Intuitiveness.

To love.

What would I do without women? Most of my joy in life has been in the presence of a woman.

Without women I start taking myself too seriously and become a goal fulfilling machine. Life becomes a bit sweeter with them.

They are sweet. They are beautiful. Openness, vulnerability. It's a mirror.

The female form is a work of art.

Because a woman you want to be better as a man.

I absolutely love what women bring I to our lives: love, beauty, pleasure.
