I call it the quantum kan because you're living so much realities at the same time.

**This is creating your inner power, man. The work we need to do every day.**

Masculinity is about being present. Nothing to prove. Nothing to compare.

As men we are the mountains. To connect with and channel our knowing.

As men we’re all about knowing. It's the mind masturbation. But being there too long takes us away.

I'm spiritual when I'm in the jungle.

For life to flow through me I need to do the work.

I know what we carry as men in this society. 

**Look into the multi orgasmic man. Don't lose your energy, man.**

Once you open up to this energy it's going to be amazing. Your sex life, 10x man. Your business 10x.

Exercises we did:
- Breathing with arms up, relax jaw and shoulders, say “ahhhh” exhaling and receive the energy. This is the feminine side.
- Step with conviction in group. It’s okay if you bump into someone.
- Walk around and acknowledge your brothers. Give them a head nod or hug them. We’re here for each other.
- Activate energy by clapping to the beat, stomping feet.
- Ground and feel the energy coming from downwards. Hold right hand pointing downwards and left hand pointing up to connect with earth and universe energies.
