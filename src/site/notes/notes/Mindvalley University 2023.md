# Reflection [[2023-07-09\|2023-07-09]]
Afterparty at burlesque was amazing. Tight space, all the people there were right or they were kicked out. Light was focused on the stage, couldn't see anything except that.

Connecting with Jon and Missy Butcher was incredible. Conversing with them was so easy and natural. They made you feel like they really enjoyed the conversation, they were very honest and open. Their presence is insane. I felt so *comfortable*, I don't know why!

It's much easier to join in existing conversation than doing cold approach.

Aaron grew in connecting with feminine energy.

"Can I hug you" as opening to start talking with Jon Butcher.

MW: let's come up with a list of interesting questions I can ask the people I meet. For specific authors and for people too.

Lukas: I synced the timing of my speech to the music and played along with the highs and lows, had a huge impact with engagement.

Remembering names: women are either good girl names or bad girl names. Label the name with cold reading.
